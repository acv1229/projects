"The staff were friendly and helpful always making my visit stress-free and efficient.

I found the nurse to be particularly attentive and knowledgeable, explaining everything clearly and reassuringly. However, the receptionist seemed distracted and disorganized at times, which made it difficult to check-in smoothly. Despite this, I was still able to get all the information I needed from them. Overall, a good experience, but room for improvement in terms of organization.

From my initial visit, I've noticed an improvement in staff professionalism. The new receptionist is more organized and welcoming, and the nurses seem more approachable and understanding. However, there's still an occasional issue with communication between departments, which can be frustrating. On the other hand, the doctors are always very kind and take the time to explain everything in detail.

I was disappointed with my recent visit, as the staff seemed uninterested in addressing my concerns. The receptionist barely acknowledged me, and the nurse didn't seem to bother explaining anything clearly. It felt like I was just a number rather than a person needing help. Despite this, I did appreciate the efficiency of the check-in process.

The staff were welcoming and friendly when I arrived, but things took a turn for the worse as the visit progressed. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and struggled to manage the flow of patients, causing delays and frustration. However, one nurse in particular stood out for her kindness and compassion towards me. She explained everything clearly and made sure I was comfortable throughout.

I've been going to this surgery for years and have always found the staff to be professional and caring. The receptionist is particularly efficient and organized, making it easy to check-in and get appointments scheduled. However, there's one nurse in particular who has consistently impressed me with her kindness and expertise. She took the time to answer all my questions and put my mind at ease.

The surgery's staff were generally unhelpful and unprofessional during my recent visit. The receptionist seemed dismissive and didn't offer any explanation or reassurance, which made me feel anxious and worried. On the other hand, the nurses in the waiting room were kind and friendly, but this wasn't enough to make up for the poor service from the reception team.

I was pleasantly surprised by the staff's professionalism during my recent visit. The receptionist was warm and welcoming, and the nurse explained everything clearly and reassuringly.

"The staff were very helpful and explained everything clearly. They went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable during my treatment. The whole process felt smooth and stress-free, from the reception area to the actual appointment with the doctor.

I found it difficult to get through to the surgery on multiple occasions due to poor phone lines and unavailability of staff. Each time I visited, I had to wait for an extended period, which was frustrating. The receptionist seemed apologetic but didn't offer any solutions or alternatives.

From a personal perspective, having regular check-ups with my GP has been invaluable for managing my diabetes effectively. The continuous monitoring and adjustments to my treatment plan have allowed me to maintain stable levels of blood sugar and make informed decisions about my diet and exercise routine. I've also appreciated the time the doctor took to discuss the latest research and advancements in the field.

The surgery was very understanding when it came to my specific needs and requirements, providing tailored care and support whenever I visited. The nurse was particularly kind and made me feel at ease during the examination process. However, on one occasion, I experienced a bit of an issue with my appointment schedule, which resulted in some inconvenience but was ultimately resolved amicably.

I had mixed feelings about the surgery's follow-up policy, as sometimes it felt like they were not actively monitoring my condition closely enough. During one instance, I found that my blood pressure levels weren't being checked regularly, leading to some concern. However, after speaking with the GP, they adjusted my care plan accordingly and ensured that my next check-up was scheduled promptly.

I recently had an appointment at this surgery for a follow-up on my ongoing treatment, which was generally satisfactory but left me feeling somewhat concerned. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and disorganized, while the nurse did their best to address my queries despite some time constraints. Nonetheless, the GP took sufficient time to discuss new developments in my condition and offered valuable guidance.

I've had inconsistent experiences with this surgery over the past year due to varying levels of communication between staff members. At times, the receptionist was extremely friendly and accommodating, but on other occasions, I encountered someone who seemed detached or unconcerned about addressing my needs. Nevertheless, when issues did arise, the GP promptly listened attentively and worked towards resolving them.

The surgery provided a comprehensive service that catered to all of my medical requirements. The staff were knowledgeable, empathetic, and genuinely cared for their patients' well-being. During one visit, however, I found the waiting area to be too warm and humid, which made me feel slightly uncomfortable during my examination.",positive,0.8922564387321472,450.0,4,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,disappointment,1,0.8922564387321472,Follow-up and Continuity of Care

I had a poor experience at this surgery. The waiting time was ridiculously long, which made me anxious and stressed. I eventually got seen by the nurse, who seemed overwhelmed with work. She barely had time to examine me before moving on to the next patient.

The GP practice provided excellent care and attention to detail. From the initial consultation to the follow-up appointment, everything ran smoothly and professionally. The receptionist was efficient and friendly, the nurse was knowledgeable and empathetic, and the doctor took the time to address all my concerns. 

This surgery is a complete disaster! I arrived early but was told it would be a 20-minute wait. I waited for what felt like an eternity before being seen by the nurse, who seemed completely disinterested in my symptoms. The GP barely spoke to me and didn't even look at my notes.

I was impressed by how understanding and compassionate my nurse was during my appointments however. They took the time to explain everything in detail and made sure I understood what was happening. The receptionist at the surgery I attend is also very helpful and always greet's me with a smile, even on busy days.

Unfortunately, the GP practice I visited recently left a lot to be desired. I had an urgent issue that needed attention and was left waiting for over 45 minutes before seeing my doctor. When I finally met with them, they seemed completely uninterested in hearing about my symptoms and barely looked at me while taking my notes. The only redeeming quality of the practice is the excellent care provided by their nurse who always shows empathy and understanding.

I recently had a terrible experience at this GP surgery and won't be returning. From the moment I walked in, the staff seemed completely disorganized and unprofessional. The receptionist was rude to me and the waiting room was chaotic with nobody checking on patients or providing any updates on our wait times.

I've been going to this GP practice for a few years now and have generally been very happy with their care.

I recently visited for my annual check-up and had a mixed experience with the reception staff. On one hand, they were very friendly and welcoming, which put me at ease. On the other hand, they seemed to be in a rush, and I felt like I was just another number in their system rather than a valued patient. The nurse was kind and explained everything clearly, but overall, it felt like my needs weren't being prioritized.

I had a really positive experience with the GP surgery, thanks in large part to the reception staff who were extremely efficient and friendly. From booking my appointment online to checking out after my visit, they made every step of the process smooth and hassle-free. The doctor was also very knowledgeable and took the time to answer all my questions.

Unfortunately, my recent visit to this GP surgery was a complete disaster. I found the reception staff to be completely unhelpful and dismissive of my concerns. When I called to book an appointment, they seemed put off by me being pregnant and told me that there were no more slots available for at least six weeks. The nurse who saw me was kind but couldn't do much to alleviate my worries about the health of my unborn child.

I recently had a mixed experience with this GP surgery, but overall I would say that it's been a solid choice for me. The reception staff are generally friendly and efficient, but sometimes they can be a bit impersonal. On one hand, I appreciate how quickly they can get you in to see the doctor when you have an urgent issue.

I have been attending this surgery for several years now and generally had positive experiences with the staff. However, in my most recent visit regarding a new prescription, the pharmacist seemed unprepared to answer all my questions about my medication regimen, which was a slight letdown considering my usual satisfaction with the practice.

The GP at this surgery is great, but the pharmacy department leaves much to be desired. When I picked up a refill for one of my chronic medications, I found out that they had accidentally filled it with an incorrect dosage, which was a major concern for me.

"The GP surgery's prescription system is somewhat confusing, but the staff tried their best to help me out. It took a few visits for them to get my medications right, but overall I'm satisfied with the care. However, I do wish they would explain things more clearly and in writing, as it's always easy to misremember what was said.

I recently had an issue with my blood pressure medication, and despite multiple requests, the surgery couldn't seem to sort out a solution for me. The GP and nurses were all very apologetic, but ultimately I felt like I was stuck in a loop.

The GP surgery's prescription system is a bit outdated, but the staff do their best to work with you. They've been accommodating with my needs over time, even when things didn't seem straightforward. My only suggestion would be for them to have more digital tools available to manage prescriptions and appointment reminders.

I recently had an issue with my blood test results, and while I appreciate that mistakes can happen, it felt like a lot of effort was required just to get the necessary information. The staff were apologetic, but it took some time to resolve the issue. Maybe having an online portal would help streamline things?

I'm really happy with the care at this GP surgery, particularly in terms of medication management. The staff are knowledgeable and take a genuine interest in your well-being.

However, the waiting time was a bit long and I had to ask several times for updates on when I could see the doctor. Overall, it was a good experience despite some minor inconvenience.

I found the accessibility of the surgery to be quite poor, with only one wheelchair-accessible entrance out of five. The staff seemed unconcerned about this issue and didn't offer any assistance or accommodations. On the other hand, the medical care I received was excellent, with the doctor taking the time to explain everything in detail. However, I couldn't shake off the feeling that my disability wasn't being taken seriously.

The surgery's online booking system is user-friendly and convenient, allowing me to schedule appointments at a time that suits me. The staff are also very responsive to my queries, answering all my questions and providing clear instructions for aftercare.

I recently had a great experience at this surgery! The receptionist was warm and welcoming, and the nurse was incredibly kind and caring. They took the time to explain everything in detail and answered all my questions thoroughly. However, I did find the waiting area to be quite cramped and uncomfortable, which detracted slightly from my overall satisfaction.

Unfortunately, my experience at this surgery was a complete letdown. The staff seemed completely disorganized and uninterested in providing good care. The waiting time was excessively long, and I had to ask several times for updates on when I could see the doctor. To make matters worse, they got my medical records wrong, which caused a significant delay in my treatment.

The surgery's accessibility features are impressive, with ramps and elevators making it easy for people with mobility issues to navigate. However, I did find the staff to be somewhat unaccommodating when I asked for special assistance. On the other hand, the medical care I received was excellent, with the doctor taking the time to explain everything in detail. The surgery's online booking system is also very convenient and easy to use.

"The GP practice has been a mixed bag for me. Initially, the receptionist was friendly and efficient, making my initial appointment stress-free. However, during my follow-up visit, I found the staff to be somewhat dismissive and uninterested in my concerns. The nurse barely acknowledged my questions, which made me feel unheard. Despite this, the doctor provided good care, but overall, I've been disappointed with the lack of continuity of care.

I had an excellent experience at this GP surgery during my initial visit. The receptionist greeted me warmly, and the nurse took time to explain everything in detail. However, during my recent follow-up appointment, I felt rushed and not attended to properly by the nurse. This has made me question the level of service I'm receiving.

The GP practice is lacking in follow-up care. After my initial appointment, I had to remind myself what treatment plan I was on when I visited again a few weeks later. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and didn't have all the necessary information readily available. It's frustrating when you need to re-explain your health issues multiple times.

I recently had an unimpressive experience at this GP surgery during my follow-up visit. The staff were completely unhelpful and unprofessional, making the entire visit feel like a waste of time. I had specific questions about my medication, but no one seemed willing to answer them or provide any guidance. This left me feeling lost and frustrated.

I've been going to this GP practice for years, and overall, I'm extremely satisfied with their care. The staff are always friendly and knowledgeable, making each visit a positive experience. However, during my last follow-up appointment, I did notice that the nurse seemed a bit distracted and didn't attend to me as thoroughly as usual.

I had mixed feelings about my recent experience at this GP surgery. On one hand, the receptionist was very helpful and made check-in easy, but on the other hand, the doctor barely spoke to me during our conversation, which left me feeling unheard and unattended to.

The GP practice I visit is one of the best I've been to, with a team that genuinely cares about their patients. The staff are always willing to listen and provide excellent care.

The nurses showed a clear lack of empathy when talking about my brother's condition. 

I had mixed feelings about the practice, some staff were caring but others seemed completely disinterested in my case. The receptionist on the first visit was friendly, but the second time was a different story. Our GP did not address our main concerns, making us feel like we were just a minor annoyance to them.

The experience with this surgery was underwhelming.

The pharmacist requested that I have annual blood test I was shocked that Chloresterol was not included in the blood test It was the surgery that prescribed atorvastin and even increased my dose This should be tested annually As I am on levothyroxin I would have thought that the blood test included thyroid tests as well I thought the lack of the chloresterol and thyroid testing was sloppy,neutral,0.4921728670597076,68.0,4,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,surprise,0,0.4921728670597076,
"The waiting room was cluttered but clean, and the reception staff seemed friendly enough. However, my appointment started 20 minutes late, which wasn't ideal. The nurse eventually saw me, but I felt rushed throughout the consultation. Despite this, they explained everything clearly and prescribed a suitable treatment plan.

I found the GP surgery to be very efficient with minimal waiting time, especially considering it was a weekday morning. The staff were all very professional and courteous, making my visit feel as stress-free as possible. My only complaint is that I had to wait for about 15 minutes before being seen, but overall, I'm extremely satisfied.

I've been going to this GP surgery for years now and have always found the waiting time to be relatively short. The staff are always friendly and welcoming, which makes a big difference in my experience. However, last time I went, I had to wait over an hour before being seen, which was frustrating.

The staff are friendly and professional, and they always seem to have a good rapport with their patients.

I was really impressed with how well-organized the GP surgery was, both in terms of waiting times and patient care. The staff were all very friendly and efficient, which made my visit a great one. However, last time I went, I had to wait over 45 minutes before being seen, which was a bit longer than usual.

The waiting room at this GP surgery could do with some modernization, but the staff are always friendly and helpful. My appointment started on time, and the nurse explained everything clearly and thoroughly. However, I did find the waiting time to be slightly longer than usual, about 30 minutes or so, which was a bit disappointing.

I've had mixed experiences at this GP surgery in terms of waiting times. Sometimes it's been very short, but other times it can be quite long - usually around 45-60 minutes.

"The GP was very helpful and explained everything clearly. The receptionist checked me in quickly but asked too many questions about my insurance.

I was frustrated with the amount of time I waited to see the doctor, it felt like an eternity. The nurse seemed put off when I mentioned a medication issue. The doctor did eventually address my concerns but not before rushing through our appointment.

The GP practice is very professional and well-run. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable about the medications they prescribe. I was impressed with how smoothly my visit went from start to finish. My questions were answered thoroughly, and I felt heard throughout the process.

I had a disappointing experience at this GP surgery. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and uninterested in checking me in.

"The staff were generally very helpful, but sometimes a bit too busy and rushed. The receptionist was friendly and made check-in easy. However, on one occasion I felt like I had to push for information and answers from the nurse. Overall, it was a positive experience, but not without some minor frustrations. The practice seems well-organized, and I appreciate the efficiency of their appointments system.

I was delighted with the professionalism displayed by the entire staff, from reception to nursing to the doctor's office. Everyone was courteous, empathetic, and explained things in a way that made sense to me. The nurse took great care of my son's injury and provided excellent follow-up support. I also appreciated the practice's commitment to keeping patients informed about any changes or updates regarding their treatment plans.

The staff were unhelpful and unprofessional on multiple occasions during my visit. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and didn't bother to check-in with me, while the nurse appeared distracted and uninterested in addressing my concerns. Despite this, I was pleased with the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and the quality of their care.

I had a generally positive experience at the surgery, but there were some issues that left me feeling frustrated.

I have been going to this surgery for years and have always had a positive experience. The staff are friendly, professional, and genuinely care about their patients. However, I did notice that the waiting area could use some modernisation - the chairs were old and uncomfortable, and there was no TV or magazines to pass the time.

I recently experienced a negative visit at this surgery, which left me feeling disappointed and frustrated. The reception staff seemed overwhelmed and disorganised, and it took ages to get an appointment booked in. When I finally saw the doctor, they barely spoke to me and didn't seem to listen to my concerns. I was also charged more than expected for my treatment.

The reception staff were polite and efficient making my visit smooth but I did feel like they were just going through the motions without much enthusiasm.

I have been seeing this doctor for many years now and have always found the staff to be absolutely fantastic. They are so professional, caring and genuinely interested in your well-being.

"The staff were friendly and helpful on this occasion, which was a relief after some bad experiences at other surgeries.

I found the facility to be quite impressive with clean and modern waiting rooms. The reception area was well-stocked with refreshments which made the wait more bearable. However, I had to ask for my records multiple times due to technical issues with the system. Overall, it was a decent experience despite some minor annoyances.

The practice itself is excellent, but the parking situation leaves much to be desired. On two separate occasions, I arrived early for an appointment only to find a spot that was already taken by someone else who didn't even arrive until after my scheduled time. This has become a frustrating regular occurrence.

I recently had to visit this surgery due to a dental emergency and was impressed by the professionalism of the staff. They were attentive, understanding, and took the necessary steps to treat my condition effectively. However, I did have some concerns regarding the length of the appointment, which made it feel somewhat rushed. 

Unfortunately, my experience at this surgery was marred by a series of unhelpful interactions with the receptionists and nurses. Each time I tried to check in or ask questions, I was met with a dismissive attitude that made me feel like my concerns were not valid. The waiting area itself was also poorly ventilated which made it difficult to breathe.

I recently had an appointment at this surgery for a chronic condition and was pleased by the high level of care provided. The staff were courteous, knowledgeable, and took the time to address all my questions and concerns. However, I did have to wait for over an hour before being seen which left me feeling frustrated and anxious about my health.

I visited this surgery after a referral from my GP and was pleased with the overall experience. The receptionist was friendly, the nurse explained everything clearly, and the doctor was very knowledgeable about my condition. However, I did have to ask for an extension on my appointment time due to unforeseen circumstances which added to my stress levels.

I was not impressed with this surgery's accessibility features, or lack thereof.

I had high expectations for this surgery due to the excellent reviews online.

The doctor seemed very busy and didn't take much time to listen to me or explain my treatment options. Overall, it was a disappointing experience.

The staff were friendly but didn't seem to know what they were doing. They kept sending me to different rooms and couldn't seem to find any of the records I needed. It was like they were making it up as they went along. The receptionist seemed put out with me at one point, which wasn't a good start.

I've been going to this surgery for years and have always had great experiences, but my most recent visit was a bit of an exception. The staff seemed professional and competent enough, but there was something about the way they interacted with each other that made it feel a bit awkward. Maybe I'm just being picky.

The staff were unhelpful and unprofessional, making the visit frustrating. They didn't seem to know how to deal with my specific situation, and I ended up feeling like I was just an annoyance to them. It's a shame because this surgery usually has good reviews.

I found the staff quite dismissive and uninterested in my concerns. The receptionist barely acknowledged me, and the nurse seemed rushed.

The staff at this surgery were very caring and compassionate, which is why I was so disappointed when things didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped.

I had mixed feelings about my experience at this surgery. On the one hand, the staff were very kind and made me feel at ease. However, I felt like they didn't take my concerns seriously enough, and I ended up leaving without getting all of the answers I needed. Maybe it was just a bad day?

I have mixed feelings about my visit to this surgery. While the receptionist was friendly and efficient, I felt like the nurse didn't explain everything clearly enough about my condition. The doctor seemed busy and didn't give me as much time to ask questions as I would have liked. However, the consultation itself was thorough and accurate.

I've had some excellent experiences at this surgery over the years, with many of the staff being extremely knowledgeable and caring. However, my most recent visit left a sour taste in my mouth due to the long wait times and unfriendly receptionist. The nurse seemed overwhelmed and rushed through our conversation, which made me feel like an inconvenience rather than a patient.

The GP at this surgery was friendly and professional, explaining everything clearly and patiently. But I felt like the waiting room was freezing cold and poorly ventilated - it really detracted from my overall experience of getting checked in.

I recently visited this surgery for a routine check-up, and while the staff were generally helpful, there was one member of the team who completely lost me.

I have to say that this surgery really delivered on its promises - from the smooth check-in process, to the thorough consultation itself, everything went smoothly. The doctor was knowledgeable, kind, and clearly explained my diagnosis and treatment options in a way that made sense to me.

The GP surgery's medication management system is excellent, making it easy for me to keep track of my prescriptions and doses. The staff are always friendly and welcoming, with a warm reception area that makes you feel at ease. I have been using this surgery for years now, and I must say that they have consistently provided high-quality care.

The GP surgery has been wonderful for me since I started attending, with the staff being very caring and attentive. However, when I asked about the potential side effects of a new medication, the nurse seemed uncertain about providing a full explanation. Thankfully, my doctor provided clarity during our subsequent appointment.

I recently went to this GP surgery with some concerns regarding my medication regimen, but unfortunately, the receptionist barely acknowledged me, and the nurse didn't seem interested in addressing my issues either.

"The reception staff were friendly but seemed very busy which made my appointment feel rushed.

I was extremely dissatisfied with the lack of availability for routine check-ups, often being left waiting for over an hour. Despite repeated calls to explain this issue, nothing has been done to improve it. The practice seems to be relying on patients to take time off work rather than providing adequate staffing. This is unacceptable and I would not recommend this surgery to anyone due to the poor appointment scheduling.

I recently visited this GP surgery for a routine check-up and was pleased with my experience. The receptionist checked me in efficiently and the nurse took the time to explain everything to me. However, when I booked my next appointment online, it wasn't possible to schedule a morning slot until two weeks later. I would have preferred something closer to home.

The GP surgery I visit regularly has a good reputation and experienced staff, but their appointment availability is often limited. They sometimes take too long to answer phone calls or respond to booking requests online, which can lead to disappointment.

I was delighted with the level of care I received from my GP at this practice, but there's one thing that keeps me coming back: the difficulty in securing appointments. Due to a high volume of patients, availability is often restricted, making it essential to book well in advance.

Unfortunately, our local GP surgery has fallen short when it comes to appointment availability. The system seems antiquated and difficult to navigate, resulting in long waiting times for both walk-in and booked appointments.

"The GP surgery was a pleasant experience for my elderly mother. The receptionist was very helpful and made sure she had all the necessary forms filled out quickly and efficiently. However, during the actual consultation, I felt that our concerns were not given the attention they deserved. Despite this, the nurse who carried out the examination seemed genuinely interested in her health and took some time to discuss any issues she was experiencing with us. Overall, a good experience but room for improvement in terms of patient care.

The GP surgery left me feeling thoroughly unimpressed with my recent visit. The waiting time was excessive and the staff seemed completely disorganised. When I finally saw the doctor, he barely looked up from his phone to answer any questions I had, before dismissing me with a perfunctory smile. I was shocked by how little attention to detail there was shown in managing even the most basic aspects of patient care.

I recently visited my local GP surgery and was thoroughly impressed by the level of professionalism displayed by all staff members. From the friendly receptionist who checked me in, to the caring nurse who conducted the examination, every single person I met went above and beyond to ensure I felt comfortable and supported throughout the entire experience. The doctor took time to explain my diagnosis and treatment options in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for me to understand what was happening. The surgery itself was clean and well-maintained, with all necessary equipment readily available.

The GP surgery where I recently had an appointment left me feeling frustrated and disillusioned. Despite having made an appointment specifically because of the high level of service promised by the practice, I found the waiting time to be incredibly long and the staff seemed completely overwhelmed. When I finally saw the doctor, he barely listened to my concerns before telling me that everything was fine and giving me a quick dismissal. The nurse who carried out the examination seemed uninterested in my symptoms and failed to ask any meaningful questions.

I recently visited my local GP surgery after receiving a referral from my previous GP. Unfortunately, the experience was not up to par. When I arrived at the surgery, I found that there were several other patients already waiting, which added to my anxiety. However, despite this chaotic start, the receptionist did manage to get me checked in relatively quickly and efficiently. The nurse who conducted the examination seemed friendly but lacked the level of expertise required for someone with my medical background. The doctor's consultation was brief and didn't provide any clear explanation of my treatment plan.

The GP surgery I recently visited left a sour taste in my mouth due to some rather underwhelming service from the receptionist. When I arrived, I found that the waiting time had already exceeded an hour, which set a rather negative tone for the rest of my visit. Furthermore, when I was called into see the doctor, I felt that the nurse who accompanied him seemed completely out of touch with my condition and struggled to explain everything in detail.

I recently visited my local GP surgery after experiencing some severe symptoms that required immediate attention. Unfortunately, the experience fell short of expectations due to some rather glaring issues with communication and care from the staff members present during my visit. When I arrived at the surgery, it took an inordinate amount of time to check me in, which only added to my growing sense of anxiety. The nurse who conducted the examination seemed somewhat uninterested in my symptoms but did manage to identify some underlying issues that needed further investigation.

The GP surgery where I received care recently was a mixed bag - some excellent elements combined with some underwhelming shortcomings. While the receptionist displayed a friendly demeanor and managed to get me checked in relatively quickly, I found the waiting room itself to be somewhat chaotic, with multiple patients waiting for different surgeries all at once. The nurse who conducted the examination seemed knowledgeable but perhaps too focused on simply getting through the task at hand rather than actively listening to my concerns.

I recently visited my local GP surgery after experiencing a persistent health issue that required ongoing management. During my visit, I found that the staff displayed a generally positive attitude towards patients and made an effort to provide clear explanations of any treatment plans or advice being offered. However, I felt that some further guidance was needed regarding how to manage my condition more effectively at home.

I recently visited my local GP surgery after receiving a referral from my previous doctor and was left feeling somewhat disappointed by the overall experience. When I arrived at the surgery, I found that there were multiple patients waiting for various appointments, which made me feel anxious about having to wait an extended period of time before being seen. The nurse who conducted the examination seemed rushed and did not take enough time to discuss my symptoms or treatment options in detail.

The GP surgery I recently visited was a typical example of a well-run practice that put patients first. From the moment I arrived, the receptionist greeted me warmly and efficiently checked me in. The nurse who carried out the examination was friendly and took the time to explain everything in detail, ensuring I understood what was happening and why. However, I did feel that the waiting room could have been more welcoming for patients.

The GP surgery left a bad taste in my mouth due to its rather callous approach towards patient care. When I arrived at the surgery, I found that there were several other patients already waiting, which added to my growing anxiety. The nurse who conducted the examination seemed completely uninterested in my symptoms and failed to ask any meaningful questions before rushing through the consultation.",positive,0.865554690361023,988.0,4,Communication Effectiveness,disappointment,1,0.865554690361023,Treatment Quality

"The GP surgery staff showed remarkable empathy during my visit, taking a genuine interest in my condition. Their explanations were clear and concise, making it easy to understand my diagnosis and treatment options. The nurse was particularly compassionate, offering words of encouragement when I needed them most. However, the wait time was excessive, which detracted from the overall experience. Despite this, the staff's kindness and professionalism made a significant impact on my visit.

The GP surgery is well-organized, with efficient check-in procedures. However, the staff seemed distracted and unenthusiastic, failing to provide the level of care I expected. The receptionist barely acknowledged me, and the nurse didn't explain my diagnosis thoroughly. It felt like they were just going through the motions. 

The GP surgery has an excellent system in place for managing chronic conditions. The staff is knowledgeable about the treatment options available. However, during our consultation, the doctor seemed overworked and rushed through our discussion. This lack of attention to detail made me feel like my concerns weren't being fully heard.

I was thoroughly disappointed with my recent visit to this GP surgery. From the moment I arrived, I felt like a mere number rather than a patient.

I had a frustrating experience at this surgery, the staff seemed completely uninterested in my concerns and barely acknowledged me when I arrived. The waiting area was also cluttered and uncomfortable, it felt like they were trying to cram as many patients in as possible.

The GP practice made a great effort to accommodate my needs, including a flexible appointment time and a private room for my consultation. The nurse was very understanding and the doctor explained everything clearly and reassuringly, making me feel at ease throughout the visit.

I found the receptionist to be completely unfriendly and unhelpful during my first visit, it seemed like she didn't care about how I was doing or what I needed. This made the whole experience feel negative from the start and made me hesitant to return in the future.

"The GP surgery staff were very friendly and helpful when I needed an urgent appointment on a Sunday. They fitted me in quickly without any hassle or delay, which was much appreciated. The nurse who attended to me was also very kind and explained everything clearly, making the experience much less stressful than expected.

I was really disappointed with my recent visit to this surgery. Despite being booked in advance for an appointment, I had to wait over 30 minutes for it to start and then another 20 minutes after that just to have a quick consultation with the GP. The staff seemed overwhelmed and short-tempered, which didn't exactly put me at ease.

The GP surgery is easily accessible by car or public transport, making it convenient for patients like myself who rely on regular appointments. The receptionist was very efficient in checking me in and preparing me for my appointment, and the nurse explained everything clearly and thoroughly to me. The doctor also took the time to answer all of my questions and provide personalized advice.

Unfortunately, I had a very poor experience at this surgery last week. The staff seemed completely disorganized and uninterested in helping me. When I arrived, I was told that my appointment had been cancelled without explanation or apology, and then spent another 20 minutes waiting for someone to sort out the issue with me. Overall, it felt like I wasn't even worth their time.

I recently visited this surgery for a routine check-up and was pleasantly surprised by how efficient and professional everything was. The receptionist checked me in quickly and smoothly, and the nurse who attended to me was very kind and thorough in explaining my test results. The GP also took the time to discuss any concerns I had and offered helpful advice.

I was really let down by my recent visit to this surgery. I had been waiting for an appointment for weeks due to a family emergency, but when I finally arrived, I was told that they were fully booked and couldn't fit me in until several weeks later. When I tried to speak with someone about alternatives or rescheduling options, the staff seemed dismissive and unhelpful.

The GP surgery is well-organized and easy to navigate, making it a convenient option for those with busy schedules. However, I had a frustrating experience when trying to make an appointment. The phone system was difficult to use, and it took several attempts to speak with someone who could help me book a slot. Despite this, the staff were friendly and helpful once I finally got through to them.

I recently visited this surgery for a minor issue that required some urgent attention. The receptionist was very efficient in checking me in and preparing me for my appointment, and the nurse who attended to me was kind and understanding.

I've been attending this GP surgery for several years now, and I've always been impressed with their professionalism and care.

The GP surgery has a great system for managing appointments, making it easy for patients like myself who rely on regular check-ups.

I recently visited this surgery for a follow-up appointment and was pleased with the level of care I received.

"The staff at this surgery were friendly and helpful, but sometimes a bit disorganized. The receptionist often forgot appointments or didn't have the right paperwork ready, which caused delays. However, when I did get seen, the doctor was knowledgeable and took the time to explain my diagnosis in detail. Overall, it's an okay place to go for minor issues, but might not be ideal for more serious problems.

I was impressed by the receptionist's warm smile and kind demeanor, but unfortunately, that didn't translate to the same level of care from the medical staff. The nurse seemed rushed and dismissive, and I felt like I was just a number rather than an actual patient. Despite this, the doctor did their best to address my concerns.

The GP surgery is run by a team that seems genuinely committed to providing excellent care. From the receptionist's welcoming greeting to the nurse's compassionate explanations, everyone I interacted with displayed a high level of professionalism and kindness.

The staff at this surgery are generally friendly, but sometimes struggle to manage their workload effectively. When I visited for a follow-up appointment, I had to wait over 30 minutes before seeing the GP, which felt inconsiderate given my previous schedule constraints. Despite this, the doctor did their best to make up for lost time.

I was really let down by the level of care I received during my recent visit to this surgery. The receptionist seemed completely disinterested in my case, and the nurse didn't even bother to explain what was wrong with me before sending me on my way. The GP was apologetic, but it felt like too little, too late.

I've been going to this surgery for years and have always been satisfied with the level of care I receive. The staff are warm, welcoming, and genuinely seem to care about their patients' well-being. The GP takes the time to explain everything in detail and answers all my questions without hesitation.

The GP surgery is generally a good place to go for routine check-ups, but sometimes feels more like a factory than a personal service.

"The staff were very helpful and polite always finding time for my appointments.

I found the appointment availability to be quite limited, often requiring me to wait several weeks or even months for an available slot. The receptionist would occasionally offer alternative dates, but it seemed like they were already fully booked. This was frustrating, especially since I have a busy schedule and struggle to fit in doctor's visits around other commitments. Despite this, the medical team themselves were always friendly and efficient.

I recently visited this surgery for an urgent appointment and was impressed by how quickly the staff managed to find time for me, even on short notice. The receptionist communicated clearly and kept me informed of the waiting times. However, I was disappointed that there wasn't more flexibility with appointment availability - I ended up having to reschedule several times due to unexpected work commitments.

I have been going to this surgery for years and have always found the staff to be extremely helpful and accommodating when it comes to scheduling appointments. The receptionist is always friendly and will go above and beyond to find a time that suits me, whether it's early morning or late evening. The only area for improvement I would suggest is increasing availability on weekends.

Unfortunately my recent experience was marred by the limited appointment availability. I had to wait several weeks for an available slot which was frustrating. When I finally got in, the nurse seemed rushed and wasn't very communicative about my treatment plan. It's disappointing that a surgery as busy as this one can't manage its scheduling better.

I recently visited this surgery for a routine check-up and was pleased with how easily I was able to book an appointment. The online system is user-friendly and allows you to choose from available time slots, which made the process very straightforward. However, when it came to finding a specific doctor I wanted to see, I found that there wasn't much flexibility in terms of availability.",neutral,0.4873073399066925,335.0,3,Appointment Availability,disappointment,1,0.4873073399066925,Appointment Availability
"The GP practice staff were unfriendly and unhelpful during my visit. 
I was trying to get a diagnosis for my chronic illness, but they seemed more interested in rushing me out than listening to my concerns. 

I recently had a great experience at this surgery! The staff were friendly and made the waiting area comfortable with refreshments available. They also offered to call if test results came back sooner than expected.

I found the GP to be dismissive of my health problems, more interested in booking me in for routine tests rather than addressing my actual concerns. The nurse seemed uninterested in answering my questions and kept glancing at her watch.

This surgery exceeded my expectations - all the staff were very helpful, kind and caring, they made sure I was comfortable throughout the visit. They even offered to have a friend or family member accompany me if needed.

Unfortunately, my experience at this GP practice was extremely poor. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and rude, the nurse appeared bored and uninterested, and the doctor barely spoke to me. I left feeling frustrated and unheard.

I recently had an excellent visit to this surgery! The staff were professional, polite, and courteous - they even took time to explain my diagnosis in detail.

"I had a mixed experience with this GP surgery. The staff were generally friendly and welcoming, but my appointment was delayed by over an hour which caused some inconvenience. When the doctor finally arrived, they were very knowledgeable and took the time to explain everything in detail, making me feel more informed about my condition. However, I felt that the nurse didn't quite follow up on our previous discussion at my last visit, so it would have been great if we had a continuity of care update. Overall, the surgery's efforts to improve patient experience were commendable, but there's still room for improvement in terms of communication and coordination between staff members.",negative,0.4474510252475738,112.0,4,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,disappointment,1,-0.4474510252475738,Follow-up and Continuity of Care

I found the staff quite dismissive and uninterested in my concerns. The receptionist barely acknowledged me, and the nurse seemed rushed. It felt like I was just another number on their list rather than an actual patient. I would not recommend this surgery to anyone.

I had a mixed experience with the reception staff, to be honest. The lady on the front desk was very apologetic when they got my name wrong, which showed she took responsibility for her mistake. However, I felt like there were long gaps between checking in and being seen by the doctor, which made me feel like I was wasting time.

I recently had a fantastic experience at this surgery, thanks to the amazing reception staff.

I had to wait 45 minutes for my appointment and was seen at 15 past the time we were supposed to meet. The nurse seemed rushed and didn't explain anything thoroughly.

Fortunately, this surgery had availability within a few days, which is exactly what I was looking for. However, when I arrived, the staff seemed somewhat unenthusiastic about helping me.

"The staff were friendly and helpful, but sometimes it felt like they didn't know what was going on. The receptionist would answer the phone and then forget about you. I had to remind them multiple times to see me. Sometimes it worked, other times not. Overall, the experience was decent, but I wouldn't recommend this surgery to anyone.

I found the staff to be completely disorganized and unprofessional. They seemed like they were having a bad day or something, but honestly, I've had better service at a fast food joint. The receptionist kept telling me that my test results would be ready ""in a minute"" for like 20 minutes straight. The nurse barely spoke to me and just handed me some papers with illegible handwriting on them. It was really frustrating.

The staff were polite and efficient, making my visit smooth and stress-free. I was seen promptly at the time I requested, and the doctor explained everything in detail.

When I asked for a refund for the unnecessary test I had done, I was told that it wasn't possible. It was a really bad experience overall.

I've been going to this surgery for years and have always been satisfied with the service. The staff are friendly and professional, and they always seem to go above and beyond to make sure you're taken care of.

"The GP practice provided adequate treatment for my condition, although I felt somewhat rushed through the appointment process. The nurse seemed overwhelmed with the number of patients to attend to. Despite this, she explained everything clearly and efficiently. Overall, I was satisfied with the service received.

I had a terrible experience at this surgery. The waiting room was dirty, and the staff seemed completely disinterested in my health concerns. When it was finally my turn to be seen, the nurse barely looked up from her phone to examine me. It took ages for the doctor to arrive, and even then, they barely spoke to me about my condition. I left feeling frustrated and unheard.

The GP practice provided excellent care for my chronic condition, thanks in part to the regular check-ins with the nurse. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, and always seemed to have a solution to any problem I was experiencing. However, there were times when it felt like they didn't listen as attentively as they should be.

I was extremely disappointed with the treatment I received from this surgery. Despite having an appointment booked for months in advance, I ended up waiting over an hour before being seen. When I finally got to speak to the nurse, she seemed put out and unhelpful, and didn't seem to take my concerns seriously. Overall, it was a very frustrating experience.

I have been going to this GP practice for years and have always received excellent care from the staff. The receptionist is always friendly, and the nurses are knowledgeable and efficient.

I waited over 45 minutes before being seen by the nurse, who barely acknowledged me as she examined me. The doctor seemed rushed and uninterested, and didn't take the time to explain anything about my condition. It was a very poor experience.

I recently had an appointment at this surgery, which left me feeling both relieved and frustrated. On the one hand, the staff were friendly and efficient, and the nurse explained everything clearly.

I recently had a disappointing experience with this surgery's reception staff. Despite my initial positive impressions, they seemed dismissive and uninterested in my concerns when I needed them most. They barely acknowledged me and seemed put off by my presence. It was an unwelcome surprise after feeling so comfortable initially.

The GP surgery has some excellent staff, but the receptionist on duty can be quite rude and unfriendly at times. She seems to be having a bad day more often than not, which is unfortunate. The other staff members are usually friendly and helpful, though.

I was pleasantly surprised by how professional and caring the GP surgery's staff were.

Overall, a great experience at this GP surgery.

I found the staff quite dismissive and uninterested in my concerns. The receptionist barely acknowledged me, and the nurse seemed rushed. When I tried to ask questions about my test results, they just told me to look at the notes on my folder. It felt like they were more interested in their phones than in helping me.

The GP was very friendly and explained everything in detail, but unfortunately that didn't make up for the long wait time. The waiting room could have been cleaner, but overall I appreciated the staff's professionalism. They made an effort to keep us informed about delays. Maybe next time we can avoid waiting so long.

I've never had a bad experience at this GP surgery before, which is why it was particularly disappointing when things didn't go well this time. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and frustrated, which put me on edge. The nurse tried to help, but the doctor's bedside manner left much to be desired. I just wish they could have managed their workload better.

The staff at this surgery are always so welcoming and friendly, it makes you feel at ease right from the start. They're always willing to listen and answer your questions.

Unfortunately, my experience at this surgery fell short in several areas. For one, the receptionist seemed completely uninterested in my concerns, and the nurse was dismissive of my questions.

The practice seemed understaffed during our visit, leaving us waiting for over 20 minutes before seeing the GP. The receptionist apologised profusely but didn't seem to have a solution to speed up the appointment process. On the plus side, the nurse was very empathetic and explained everything in simple terms.

I recently attended an appointment with this surgery and was thoroughly impressed by the service we received. From check-in to consultation, everything ran smoothly and efficiently. The receptionist was pleasant and helpful, the nurse was kind and attentive, and the doctor was knowledgeable and professional.

Unfortunately, my visit to this GP surgery was marred by a chaotic waiting area and disorganised staff.

The GP surgery has a great reputation, but unfortunately, that hasn't always translated to a good patient experience for me.

"Staff were kind but not patient enough.
I had to wait for 20 minutes before being seen, which was inconvenient. The nurse explained my diagnosis clearly, though. Overall, a decent experience, but room for improvement.

The receptionist was unfriendly and dismissive of my concerns.
I asked about medication options and was told there were none available without a long waiting period. The doctor seemed busy and barely spoke to me during the appointment. I felt like just another number in their system rather than an actual patient. When I asked for a prescription, they sent someone else to get it for me.

The staff showed empathy when my pet was injured.
They took time to understand what had happened and provided excellent care to both me and my cat. The nurse was particularly kind and gave me detailed instructions on how to care for my pet's wound. I felt supported throughout the entire process, which was greatly appreciated.

I found the staff unresponsive to my needs.
The receptionist didn't offer any assistance when I first arrived, and the nurse seemed overworked. When I asked a question during the appointment, the doctor barely looked up from their notes. It felt like they were not genuinely interested in helping me.

It was a thoroughly unpleasant experience.

The GP I saw today was very understanding and empathetic, which is something that not all doctors can claim. She listened attentively to my concerns and took the time to explain everything in detail. Her professionalism and kindness made me feel at ease, and I would definitely recommend her to others.

I had a really good experience with this surgery, but one thing that did bother me was that they didn't have any clear information about wait times or appointment schedules. The receptionist seemed uncertain when I asked about the waiting room, which was a bit concerning. However, the staff were all very friendly and made up for it.

The surgery itself was quite impressive, with state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. However, what really stood out to me was the exceptional care that the staff provided.

"The GP surgery was easily accessible for people with mobility issues, but the waiting room was too hot. The reception staff were friendly and helped me find a seat as quickly as possible. However, I was kept waiting for over 20 minutes before being seen by the doctor, which was disappointing given their advertised wait times. 

I recently visited this GP surgery for an appointment after having a work accident. Unfortunately, the experience left a sour taste in my mouth. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed with other patients, and it took several attempts to get anyone's attention to check-in. Once I finally got seen by the doctor, they were very competent and caring but the long wait was frustrating.

The GP surgery is conveniently located near my home, which made it easy to pop in for a quick appointment if needed. The waiting area was comfortable, with plenty of seating options and magazines to browse through. However, when I visited last week, there seemed to be only one receptionist on duty, who was clearly overwhelmed by the number of patients waiting. Despite this, they remained cheerful and apologetic throughout my visit.

I recently had a good experience at this GP surgery. The staff were very professional and friendly, which put me at ease during what can be an anxious time for many people. My appointment ran smoothly from start to finish, with the nurse taking the time to answer all of my questions thoroughly and the doctor providing clear explanations of my treatment options.

I have mixed feelings about this GP surgery after visiting them for a recurring illness. On the one hand, I was seen by a kind and caring doctor who took the time to listen to my concerns. However, I felt rushed through my appointment and wasn't given enough time to ask all of my questions. 

The GP surgery is great in terms of accessibility, with wide doors and accessible toilets. The waiting area is also spacious and has plenty of seating options.

"The staff were friendly and accommodating, always booking appointments well in advance, making it easy for us to schedule our regular check-ups.

I had a mixed experience with the appointment availability at this surgery. While they were generally good about getting back to me when I called, sometimes the wait time was quite long. The receptionist would often apologize profusely and try to make up for lost time, but it still felt like a hassle at times. On the other hand, they did go above and beyond to accommodate my schedule on multiple occasions, which really impressed me. Overall, I'd say their appointment system is decent, but room for improvement.

I've been going to this surgery for years, and I have to say that their appointment availability has always been a major issue. Sometimes it feels like they're not doing enough to manage the demand, resulting in lengthy wait times. However, on my last visit, I was pleased to see that they had introduced an online booking system, which made scheduling much easier for me. The receptionist was also very helpful and accommodating, which made a big difference.

"The GP surgery's appointment availability is a mixed bag. While it's easy to get an appointment at short notice for non-emergency cases, it can be near impossible to book something in under 24 hours for more serious issues. I've found myself being told there are no slots available because the GP is on holiday or attending a conference and the receptionist seems completely unbothered by my frustration.

I was pleasantly surprised by how professional and caring the staff were during my appointment. However, the appointment availability could be improved - I had to wait over an hour to be seen and there wasn't much information provided about waiting times or potential delays. Overall, it's a good practice, but needs some fine-tuning to ensure patients like me aren't left hanging for hours.

I was really impressed with how efficient the GP surgery is when it comes to appointment availability - I was able to get an emergency appointment booked on the same day within 30 minutes of calling. The staff were friendly and explained everything clearly, making me feel at ease from the start. However, I did find that some non-emergency appointments are harder to come by, especially for weekends or after 6pm.

Unfortunately, my experience with this GP surgery was a complete disaster - they only had one appointment available on short notice for a serious medical condition, and it turned out to be a botched diagnosis. The receptionist seemed completely uninterested in my concerns and the nurse barely spoke to me before the doctor gave me some hasty advice that I later found to be incorrect.

I've been going to this GP surgery for years and have always had good experiences with appointment availability. However, recently I've noticed it's become more difficult to get an appointment on short notice - especially during peak hours. The staff are still friendly and professional, but I think they could do better in terms of flexibility and adaptability.

The GP surgery has a very outdated system for booking appointments online, which made it difficult for me to find a suitable time slot. However, when I finally did get through to the receptionist, she was extremely helpful and patient, and managed to book me an appointment at short notice. It's clear that they value their patients' convenience.

I had a very good experience with this GP surgery in terms of appointment availability - I was able to get an appointment booked on a weekday morning within 15 minutes of calling. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the doctor seemed genuinely interested in my concerns. However, I did find that some appointments can be difficult to book at short notice for weekend or evening slots.

I've recently moved to this area and was relieved to find that this GP surgery has a good reputation when it comes to appointment availability - they're able to accommodate last-minute requests with ease. The receptionist is very friendly and chatty, which put me at ease from the start. However, I did notice that some appointments can be quite long, sometimes taking over an hour.

I was really impressed with how responsive this GP surgery is when it comes to appointment availability - they're always willing to accommodate last-minute requests, even on short notice. The staff are very friendly and caring, making me feel at ease from the start. My only suggestion would be for them to provide more information about waiting times or potential delays.

I've had a few mixed experiences with this GP surgery when it comes to appointment availability - sometimes I'm able to get an appointment on short notice, but other times I have to wait weeks in advance.

The GP surgery provided excellent care during my visit, which was both timely and thorough. From check-in to diagnosis and treatment plan, everything went smoothly. The staff were knowledgeable and professional throughout. However, what did strike me as slightly unusual was the amount of information provided on various health topics via leaflets in the waiting room.

When my appointment finally arrived, the doctor spent more time explaining the benefits of a new medication than actually addressing my concerns. Overall I would not recommend this practice to anyone who values personalized care.

I recently visited this GP surgery for the first time and was pleasantly surprised by how professional and caring the staff were. The receptionist made check-in easy and the nurse was incredibly kind, checking in with me regularly to see if I needed anything. However, when my appointment finally arrived, the doctor seemed rushed and didn't have time to answer all of my questions thoroughly.

The GP practice is generally well-run but has some areas for improvement. The waiting room could be larger and more comfortable, and the nurses seem to be under-trained on certain medical procedures. When I visited last week, one of the nurses seemed uninterested in addressing my concerns about a persistent headache, which was frustrating. Overall I would recommend this practice to others if they have no other options.

The GP surgery is easily accessible by public transportation but that's about where its advantages end. The waiting room was small and cramped, and the staff seemed completely disorganized, with patients being called in for appointments without any clear order of priority. When my appointment finally arrived, the doctor spent most of the time taking phone calls rather than attending to me. It was a chaotic and unproductive visit overall.

I visited this GP surgery on multiple occasions when I needed urgent medical attention and found the staff to be consistently helpful and responsive. The receptionist always managed to fit me in quickly and the nurses were knowledgeable and caring. However, there is one drawback: they often run out of time slots available, which means I sometimes have to wait for an extended period before seeing a doctor.",negative,0.6745213270187378,511.0,3,Accessibility and Convenience,disappointment,1,-0.6745213270187378,Accessibility and Convenience

"The staff showed great empathy and understanding towards my situation, which greatly reduced my anxiety levels during the consultation.

I was pleased with how compassionate and kind the GP was, taking the time to explain everything clearly and answer all my questions. However, the waiting room felt cramped and uncomfortable, and I had to ask for a chair as it was already occupied by an elderly patient.

From my initial phone call to booking the appointment, the receptionist was extremely friendly and helpful, answering all my questions about the process and reassuring me that everything would be taken care of. The GP took the time to listen attentively to my concerns and provided personalized advice. The only issue I had was with the paperwork being slightly outdated.

I found the staff at this surgery to be extremely disorganized and unhelpful, which made my experience feeling rushed and stressful.

"I had a good visit, but the follow-up on my test results was slow. It took three weeks for them to get back to me. I've since seen my doctor twice more, and while they were friendly, I'm still waiting to hear about the next step. I'm hoping it's not just a delay due to bureaucracy.

The staff at this GP surgery are absolutely fantastic! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with kindness and compassion by the receptionist. The nurse who saw me was so attentive and explained everything in detail. My doctor came in to talk to me personally about my test results and made sure I understood what they meant. The follow-up appointments have been seamless too - no issues or delays at all! The team are genuinely caring and professional.

I recently had a bit of an issue with my blood pressure medication, but the GP practice took it very seriously.

"The GP practice is generally good but had a few issues with follow-up care. After my initial appointment, I received a series of reminders about upcoming tests and appointments which was great for keeping track of my treatment plan.

However, during the 6 months following the initial checkup, I experienced several minor health issues that seemed to be ignored by the practice. Despite multiple phone calls and messages, I never got any responses from the GP or their team, making me feel like a forgotten patient.

I eventually had to seek alternative advice elsewhere which was costly and time-consuming. I would recommend this surgery to others if they are happy with receiving automated reminders but struggle with ongoing care.

I found waiting time to be excessive, taking over 30 minutes to be seen by the doctor despite arriving early.

"The GP practice provided a generally good experience. However, the follow-up appointments could be better. The nurse seemed uninterested in my concerns, which made me feel like I wasn't being heard.

I was pleased with the level of care I received during my initial appointment. The doctor took time to explain everything and answered all my questions thoroughly. But when it came to follow-up, things started to go downhill. The receptionist didn't offer a new appointment date until I asked multiple times. It seemed like they were too busy to care.

I recently had an excellent experience with the GP surgery. From the moment I walked in, I was treated with kindness and professionalism. The nurse explained my diagnosis clearly and gave me all the necessary information about treatment options. However, when it came to follow-up, things fell apart. They lost my appointment notice, and I had to call them multiple times to reschedule.

The GP practice has a good system in place for routine check-ups, but their approach to handling more complex issues is lacking. The nurse seemed overwhelmed with the number of patients they were seeing at once, which made me feel like I was just another face in the crowd. They didn't take the time to explain everything clearly or answer all my questions thoroughly.

I've been going to this GP surgery for years and have always had a good experience. However, during my latest follow-up appointment, things fell apart.

I've been trying to get a follow-up appointment with this GP surgery for weeks, but every time I call, I'm told that there's no available slot until three months down the line. The receptionist seems completely unhelpful and uninterested in finding me a suitable alternative date. It's frustrating to feel like my concerns are being ignored.

The GP practice had a good initial consultation with me, but their follow-up care was subpar. The nurse seemed distracted and didn't take the time to explain everything clearly.

It felt like I was just another number in their system rather than an actual person.

I recently had an experience with this GP surgery that left me feeling really disappointed. The receptionist seemed completely unhelpful and uninterested in finding me a suitable appointment time.

"The staff were friendly but overworked, leading to long wait times. 

I had a good experience with my GP surgery overall, the waiting room was comfortable and well-stocked. The receptionist was efficient and organized, which made my appointment run smoothly. However, I did find the doctor to be somewhat dismissive of my concerns during our consultation. Despite this, they did provide me with a thorough diagnosis and treatment plan, which put my mind at ease.

The GP surgery was surprisingly convenient for someone with limited mobility, as there were facilities available for people with disabilities.

I had a mixed experience at the GP surgery, the receptionist was friendly but seemed overwhelmed with work. She took ages to check me in and didn't have all my notes ready which caused a delay. The nurse who came out to see me was lovely but it felt like I was just a number not an actual patient.

I recently had a very positive experience at this surgery the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming they explained everything clearly and made sure I understood what was going on.

The GP surgery left a lot to be desired, the receptionist seemed completely uninterested in checking me in and took ages to do so. When I needed to ask some questions it was clear that she wasn't going to bother answering them properly which made my visit feel really frustrating.

The staff were generally kind, and I appreciated their efforts to make me feel comfortable.

I recently visited this GP practice and was really let down by the experience. From the moment I walked in, I felt like just another number, not a person needing help. The receptionist barely looked up from her phone to greet me and seemed annoyed when I asked for a appointment at short notice. The nurse was friendly but rushed through my consultation, and the doctor didn't even bother to introduce themselves before launching into a long lecture about my symptoms.

The GP practice staff were unfriendly and dismissive of my concerns during my visit yesterday. The receptionist seemed put off by my questions and barely acknowledged me. When I asked for a second opinion, she rolled her eyes and told me the doctor would sort it out. The nurse was equally unhelpful, and I left feeling frustrated and unheard.

I've been going to this surgery for years and have always been satisfied with the service. However, my most recent visit left a sour taste in my mouth.

The GP practice I visited last week had some significant issues that prevented me from having a good experience.

The staff at this surgery are absolutely delightful! They make you feel so welcome and comfortable, answering all your queries and making sure you have a smooth experience from start to finish.

This surgery's reception staff were completely unfriendly and unprofessional, failing to greet me properly when I arrived for my appointment. Their dismissive attitude made the entire visit unpleasant.

I recently had an issue with my prescription that was not resolved by the pharmacy but somehow magically resolved at this surgery within an hour of arriving. The receptionist seemed genuinely sorry for the inconvenience caused.

Unfortunately, my experience with the GP's reception staff at this practice was a disaster from start to finish. The initial phone call I made was met with a completely unhelpful and uninterested person who failed to address any concerns or provide any relevant information.

"The staff were friendly and attentive, making my visit comfortable and stress-free. They answered all my questions thoroughly and explained everything in detail. The receptionist was particularly helpful, assisting me with my appointment and paperwork. However, I did notice that they seemed a bit short-staffed at times, which might contribute to some delays.

I found the staff to be quite unprofessional and dismissive during my visit. They barely acknowledged my concerns and didn't take the time to explain anything properly. The nurse seemed completely disinterested in my well-being, and the receptionist just repeated the same generic phrases without any empathy. I left feeling frustrated and unheard.

The practice staff were absolutely fantastic - so polite, kind, and efficient! From check-in onwards, they made sure everything ran smoothly, answering all my questions and reassuring me about every aspect of my care. Even the most minor details were taken care of with a smile. The receptionist's warm welcome set the tone for an excellent experience.

I was really disappointed with the service I received at this GP surgery. The staff seemed completely overwhelmed and uninterested in helping me, which made me feel like just another number rather than a patient in need of care. The nurse barely looked up from her phone to speak to me, and the doctor didn't even bother asking how I was before rushing through our appointment.

I recently visited this GP surgery and had an excellent experience overall. The staff were extremely professional, kind, and caring - the receptionist made check-in a breeze, and the nurse took the time to answer all my questions thoroughly. The only minor issue was that they seemed to be running slightly behind schedule, but it didn't detract from my overall satisfaction.

Unfortunately, my experience at this GP surgery was quite underwhelming. The staff seemed completely disorganized and lacked any real enthusiasm for helping patients. The receptionist kept apologizing for delays, but those were frequent and frustrating. I felt like I was just an inconvenience rather than a person in need of care - which made the whole visit really uncomfortable.

I recently had a mixed experience at this GP surgery. On the one hand, the staff were generally very professional and efficient - check-in ran smoothly, and my appointment time was respected. However, when it came to addressing my actual health concerns, I felt like they were too focused on processing me quickly rather than providing proper care. It left me feeling a bit neglected.

The practice staff at this GP surgery showed great kindness and compassion towards their patients - which is really something that stands out in a busy healthcare setting.

"The staff at this surgery are a breath of fresh air. They are always happy to see you and make an effort to understand your concerns. The receptionist, in particular, has gone above and beyond for me on multiple occasions. I've never had a bad experience here, but one time the nurse seemed quite dismissive when I asked about test results.

Their empathetic approach is truly impressive and sets them apart from other surgeries. However, during my last visit, I was left waiting for over 30 minutes despite being told it would only take 15. The receptionist apologized profusely, but I couldn't help feeling a bit frustrated.

The staff's genuine concern for their patients' well-being is evident in everything they do. From the moment you walk in, they make an effort to put you at ease and address any concerns you may have. Their kindness and professionalism are truly admirable.

Unfortunately, my experience was marred by a dismissive attitude from one of the staff members. Despite this, I will continue to recommend this surgery to anyone in need of medical care due to its exceptional reputation for compassion and care.

I've been seeing this doctor for several years now, and I can confidently say that the entire team is absolutely fantastic. They have a way of making you feel heard and understood, even on your most stressful days. The staff's empathy and kindness are truly a breath of fresh air in an often impersonal medical system.

However, there was one instance where I felt completely overlooked by the nurse. Despite being the primary caregiver for my elderly mother, who suffers from chronic pain, she seemed to be more focused on other patients than assisting me. It was disappointing, but not enough to deter me from recommending this surgery to others.",positive,0.9217316508293152,300.0,4,Staff Empathy and Compassion,disappointment,1,0.9217316508293152,Staff Empathy and Compassion
"The GP practice staff were unfailingly friendly but somewhat disorganized, leading to a lengthy wait at the reception desk. I was eventually seen by a doctor who took the time to listen attentively to my concerns and provided sound advice.

I found the nurse's bedside manner lacking, however, as she seemed more focused on hurrying me through the examination than actually assessing my condition. The waiting room was also uncomfortably warm, with no adequate ventilation to speak of.

The GP practice had a very positive atmosphere, with friendly receptionists and caring nurses who genuinely seemed to want to help. However, I did notice that the doctor's appointments were sometimes booked incorrectly, resulting in me being seen by someone else altogether. This was resolved amicably when I brought it to their attention, but still a minor annoyance.

My experience at the surgery was marred by a lack of clarity regarding my test results, which kept me on tenterhooks for several days. The receptionist did eventually call to provide some reassurance, and I received a satisfactory explanation from the doctor. Still, it would have been better if the practice had kept me informed about what was happening.

The GP practice is run with military precision, with staff moving quickly through each department to minimize waiting times. While this may be efficient for most patients, it sometimes results in me feeling like I'm just a cog in a machine rather than an individual patient.

I must admit that my experience at the surgery was somewhat mitigated by the excellent care and compassion provided by the GP themselves, who took the time to listen attentively to my concerns. However, the practice's failure to keep me informed about any changes to my treatment plan left me feeling uncertain and anxious.

Despite some minor hiccups, I was overall very pleased with the service provided by the surgery, from the friendly receptionists to the caring nurses and the competent GP. My only suggestion would be for the practice to invest in improving their communication systems, so that patients like myself can stay better informed about what's happening with our care.

The GP practice is run with a focus on efficiency, which sometimes results in me feeling like I'm just another number rather than an individual patient. However, when it comes to actual medical care, the staff are top-notch and genuinely seem to want to help patients get better.

I had a mixed experience at the surgery, as some of the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, while others seemed completely disinterested in my well-being. The GP took the time to explain everything clearly and was very reassuring throughout the appointment, but I did have some trouble getting through to the receptionist about some minor issues with my appointment.

"The reception staff were friendly and helpful. They booked me in quickly and answered all my questions. Their professionalism and kindness made a big difference in what could have been a stressful experience.

I was disappointed with the service at this GP surgery. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and didn't get my appointment right. It took ages to get seen by the doctor, and even then, I had to wait another 20 minutes before being called. The whole experience felt rushed and unprofessional. I've used other surgeries in the past where the staff have been more efficient and courteous.

The reception staff were polite and friendly, but lacked any real knowledge about the surgery. They couldn't answer my questions or provide me with any information about what would happen during my appointment. This made it difficult for me to feel prepared and at ease. 

I had a great experience at this GP surgery, thanks in part to the reception staff who were extremely helpful and welcoming. The doctor was also very friendly and explained everything in detail. I felt heard and understood throughout the visit, which is something that's not always the case with healthcare services.

The reception staff at this surgery were completely unfriendly and unhelpful. They seemed put off by my presence and didn't offer me any assistance or support. The entire experience was unpleasant and left a bad taste in my mouth. I won't be returning to this surgery again anytime soon.

I had mixed feelings about my visit to this GP surgery, mainly due to the reception staff who were pleasant but also rather impersonal. They seemed more focused on getting me checked in than actually attending to my needs or concerns. The doctor was fine, but overall it felt like a standard, routine experience that lacked any real personal touch.

The GP surgery's reception staff were well-organized and efficient, booking me in quickly and providing me with a clear explanation of what would happen during my appointment. They also offered me a refreshing cup of tea to make waiting more bearable. Overall, I was impressed by their professionalism and courtesy.

I left the GP surgery feeling frustrated and disappointed with the reception staff who seemed completely uninterested in helping me. They barely acknowledged me when I arrived, didn't offer any assistance or support, and made it clear that they would rather be anywhere else.

"The surgery's waiting area was clean but dull, with outdated magazines on a low table. The reception staff seemed put upon, but they checked me in efficiently. As I waited for my appointment, the air conditioning hummed quietly, providing some comfort. When the nurse called my name, she apologized for the delay and explained everything clearly. Overall, it was a decent experience, but not outstanding.

I had mixed feelings about this GP surgery. The reception area was modern and clean, which was a plus. However, when I asked the nurse about my test results, she seemed hesitant to share them with me, citing HIPAA rules as an excuse. It made me feel like they were hiding something. On the other hand, the doctor who saw me later was kind and explained everything in detail, so that balanced it out somewhat.

I recently had a good experience at this GP surgery. The receptionist checked me in quickly, and the nurse was friendly and attentive. When I met with the doctor, she was knowledgeable and took my concerns seriously. The waiting area could use some refreshments, but overall, I'm happy to return here for my medical needs.

The GP surgery's atmosphere was pleasant enough, with comfortable chairs and a nice view of the garden. However, when I arrived, I had to wait for over 20 minutes before being seen, which was inconvenient. The staff seemed busy and distracted, but the doctor did make an effort to talk to me and answer my questions. Still, I wouldn't recommend waiting that long.

I've been going to this GP surgery for years, and it's always a mixed bag. On the one hand, the reception area is well-organized and clean, with friendly staff who check you in efficiently. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like they're understaffed and overwhelmed, leading to delays. The doctor I saw recently was kind and competent, but I've had more frustrating experiences in the past.

The GP surgery's decor was uninspired, with plain walls and a lack of personality. However, when I met with my nurse, she was warm and caring, and explained everything clearly and patiently. When I left, I felt like they'd actually listened to my concerns. That made all the difference in an otherwise unremarkable experience.

I had a disappointing visit at this GP surgery. The waiting area was cramped and uncomfortable, with worn-out furniture that seemed neglected. The staff seemed disorganized and unfriendly, particularly when it came time to check me in. The doctor I saw later was competent but didn't seem interested in talking to me about my concerns. Overall, I'd rather not recommend this surgery.

The GP surgery's modern waiting area was a welcome change from the drabness of other medical offices I've visited. However, when I asked for a referral to a specialist, the receptionist seemed hesitant and didn't offer many options, which made me feel like I was being sent elsewhere because they couldn't handle my condition. The doctor who saw me later was kind but ultimately unhelpful.

I recently had an experience at this GP surgery that left me feeling frustrated and unheard. The waiting area was modern and comfortable, which is always a plus in my book.

I recently visited this GP practice and had a generally good experience, apart from the long wait time in the waiting room. The nurse who treated me was very knowledgeable and explained everything I needed to know about my condition.
However, our recent visit was a complete letdown. The receptionist was completely unhelpful, and the doctor seemed rushed and dismissive of my concerns.

"The staff were very helpful and friendly but the waiting time was extremely long.

I found the GP practice quite convenient as they offer evening appointments which suits my work schedule perfectly. However, I've noticed that sometimes it can get quite busy and there's a long queue to check in.

I recently visited this surgery for the first time and had a very positive experience. The receptionist was welcoming and efficient, and the nurse explained everything clearly. However, when the doctor came in to see me, she seemed rushed and didn't take the time to answer all my questions thoroughly. Overall, it was a good visit but not exceptional.

The GP practice I attend has excellent appointment availability, with flexible morning and evening sessions that suit my busy schedule. Unfortunately, the waiting room could be cleaner, but overall, I'm very happy with the service provided. The staff are always polite and friendly, even on particularly busy days.

I have mixed feelings about this surgery. On the one hand, the receptionist was extremely helpful and made sure I had everything I needed before my appointment.

"The staff were very friendly and helpful making my visit easy.

I had a mixed experience with the GP surgery staff, some were very attentive but others seemed disinterested. The receptionist was efficient but didn't explain much about what would happen during the appointment. The nurse who saw me was kind but didn't answer all my questions thoroughly. Overall it was an okay visit but I think they could improve on communication.

I recently had a great experience at this surgery, from the moment I arrived everyone was extremely welcoming and professional. The receptionist offered me a cup of tea, the nurse checked in with me during my appointment, and the doctor explained everything clearly and made time to answer all my questions. The staff were also very understanding when I mentioned some concerns I had about my condition.

I have mixed feelings about the GP surgery I recently visited. Some of the staff were friendly and helpful, but others seemed completely disinterested in my situation. The receptionist barely acknowledged me, and the nurse seemed rushed throughout our appointment. Despite that, one of the doctors took a few extra minutes to explain everything and offered some valuable advice.

I had an extremely poor experience at this surgery, unfortunately. From the moment I arrived, everything felt chaotic and disorganized. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and was gruff with me, and the nurse who saw me barely spoke to me at all. When I asked the doctor a few questions during our appointment, they barely looked up from their phone and didn't seem interested in responding. Overall it was a very frustrating experience.

"I had mixed feelings about the GP surgery's appointment availability. The receptionist was friendly, but the online system kept crashing, causing delays. They did eventually get me booked in, though. On my next visit, I found the waiting area clean and comfortable.

However, during my last appointment, I was disappointed with how long I had to wait before seeing the doctor. The staff seemed overwhelmed, and it took over an hour to be seen. When I complained about the delay, the receptionist just apologetically said they were short-staffed. It's not ideal when you're already feeling unwell.

I was really impressed with how well-organized the GP surgery's appointment system is. They have online booking available and a helpful team at the front desk. I booked an appointment in advance, but it was easy to get a same-day slot if needed. The receptionist even offered some advice on what to do while I waited.

Unfortunately, my experience with the GP surgery's appointment availability left me feeling frustrated. They cancelled my initial appointment at the last minute due to 'overbooking', and when I called to rebook, I was told it would be weeks before I could get in.

"The GP staff were friendly and helpful, making my visit easy and stress-free. However, I was surprised they didn't explain the costs of the procedures clearly, leaving me with a lot to think about afterwards.

I recently visited this surgery for the first time and was impressed by the professionalism of the staff. The receptionist was very welcoming and made sure I had all the necessary paperwork sorted before my appointment. The nurse who attended to me was kind and explained everything in detail, but the doctor seemed rather brief and didn't answer all my questions thoroughly.

The GP surgery left a bad impression on me due to the unprofessional behavior of some staff members. When I visited, the receptionist was unfriendly and seemed more concerned with her phone than attending to patients. The nurse who came in to check on me appeared to be new and made several mistakes during the examination.

I had a great experience at this GP surgery, thanks mainly to the excellent service provided by the staff. From the initial greeting by the receptionist to the detailed explanation of my diagnosis by the doctor, everything went smoothly. The nurse also showed compassion and kindness throughout the appointment, making me feel comfortable and cared for.

Unfortunately, my visit to the GP surgery was marred by the inconsiderate behavior of some staff members. The receptionist seemed annoyed at having to deal with patients during peak hours, and the nurse appeared distracted and didn't address any of my concerns.

The overall experience at this GP surgery was quite disappointing due to the poor level of service provided by some staff.

I recently visited this GP surgery for the first time and was pleased by the professionalism of most staff members. However, I did experience some difficulties with check-in due to an outdated system. The nurse who attended to me made up for it with excellent care and a willingness to answer all my questions thoroughly.

The GP surgery left a bad taste in my mouth due to the dismissive behavior of one of the receptionists. When I visited, she seemed put off by having to deal with patients during non-peak hours and barely acknowledged me when I arrived. The nurse who came in to check on me didn't seem much better, appearing distracted throughout our conversation.

"Excellent care from a dedicated team, they listened to my concerns and explained everything clearly. The follow-up appointment was smooth and efficient, the receptionist checked me in promptly. I felt valued as a patient and would highly recommend this surgery.

I found the staff quite dismissive and uninterested in my concerns during my recent visit. The receptionist barely acknowledged me, and the nurse seemed rushed. However, after speaking with the practice manager, they offered to re-examine my symptoms, which has since improved significantly. I'm grateful for their efforts to improve my care.

The surgery clinic exceeded my expectations in every way. From the warm welcome at reception to the thorough explanation of my treatment plan by the nurse. The follow-up appointment was also well-organized and hassle-free, with a clear update on my progress from the doctor. The staff's attention to detail and caring nature made a significant positive impact.

I have mixed feelings about this surgery clinic. While the initial consultation was friendly and informative, I felt that some aspects of my care were lacking. For instance, I had to ask several times for clarification on certain points during my visit. However, upon speaking with the practice manager, I received a more detailed explanation and reassurance about future appointments.

Unfortunately, my experience at this surgery clinic fell short of expectations in many areas. The receptionist was unfriendly and unhelpful, which made me feel unwelcome from the start. When I asked to speak with someone in charge, they seemed annoyed rather than apologetic. To make matters worse, there were long wait times during my appointment.

I recently had a positive experience at this surgery clinic despite some initial concerns. The receptionist was friendly and checked me in promptly, which set a positive tone for the visit. However, I did have to ask several questions about my treatment plan, which the nurse answered patiently. Overall, I felt well cared for and would recommend this clinic.

The staff at this surgery clinic failed to deliver on their promises of excellent patient care. Despite initial optimism after an impressive first consultation with a friendly receptionist, things took a downward turn during subsequent appointments. The nurses seemed disorganized, and the doctors were dismissive, leading to frustration. I was eventually able to get in touch with the practice manager but only after multiple attempts.

The surgery clinic provided good care for my initial consultation but left me feeling disappointed and underwhelmed by some aspects of my follow-up appointment.

"The staff were friendly and welcoming but took ages to see the doctor.

I had a mixed experience with the GP surgery, some of the staff were very professional and helpful while others seemed completely disinterested in my well-being.

However, the nurse who saw me next was absolutely lovely and took the time to explain everything clearly and reassuringly.

The receptionist seemed completely overwhelmed and kept apologising for the delay, while the nurse who eventually saw me was somewhat curt and dismissive.

The GP surgery staff were extremely friendly and welcoming, making me feel at ease from the moment I arrived. However, there were some issues with communication - I had to ask for my test results multiple times before they were finally sent to me, and the nurse who explained everything to me seemed a bit abrupt.

On the other hand, the doctor's bedside manner was exceptional, and they took the time to explain everything in detail. Overall, I would recommend this surgery for its medical expertise but not for its administrative efficiency. Despite the wait, the treatment itself was effective and I felt better after the visit. The practice could benefit from improving their scheduling system to reduce patient wait times.",negative,0.6749582886695862,101.0,4,Administrative Efficiency,approval,1,-0.6749582886695862,Treatment Quality

"The GP surgery staff were very helpful and knowledgeable about vaccinations. I was able to get all my questions answered and receive my shots efficiently.

I had a negative experience at this surgery, the nurse seemed rushed and didn't explain anything properly, but the receptionist made up for it by being friendly and welcoming.

We recently relocated to this area and needed vaccinations as soon as possible. The staff were very efficient and understanding of our circumstances. They explained everything clearly and made sure we left with all the necessary paperwork done. Overall a great experience.

The GP surgery was convenient, but unfortunately, the nurse was unprofessional and seemed put off by my concerns about vaccination side effects.

I recently visited this surgery for a booster shot and was impressed by the staff's expertise in vaccinations. They answered all my questions thoroughly and made sure I was comfortable throughout the process. The only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars is because they were quite busy, but that didn't affect their professionalism one bit.

The vaccination experience at this surgery was frustrating due to a long wait time and a dismissive nurse who barely acknowledged me. Despite this, the receptionist tried her best to make me feel more comfortable.",positive,0.884873628616333,209.0,2,Reception Staff Interaction,admiration,1,0.884873628616333,Vaccinations
I saw the practice nurse on 2 May 2024 regarding a very sensitive matter She confirmed she would call me to follow up on 8 May 2024 at 12 noon after she had liaised with the GP I made arrangements to be available to speak with her at that time however when she didn t call I rang the surgery only to be told by the Receptionist that the nurse had not spoken with the GP yet It is now 20 May 2024 and I still haven t heard from the nurse No follow up or courtesy call to update me I appreciate that she has a full caseload and may not have been able to get a response from the GP yet however I would expect her to keep in touch Perhaps the nurse doesn t consider it necessary but given thr sensitive nature of my conversation with her I would have thought it would be appropriate for her to get in touch as an indication of how difficult I found discussing the issue with her It makes me disinclined to engage with the nurse going forward as I consider manners and an understanding approach to be paramount in patient practice communications I will arrange to speak to the GP directly to discuss the next steps Please relay this feedback to the practice manager who is welcome to call me,neutral,0.8416529894,227.0,2,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,neutral,0,0.8416529894,
"The reception staff were friendly and helpful always making my visits a pleasure.

I was really let down by our last visit, the receptionist seemed completely uninterested in my symptoms, it felt like I was just another number to them. The waiting time was also ridiculously long.

From what I've experienced, the GP surgery seems to have its act together, with reception staff who are always cheerful and efficient. They make sure you're seen as soon as possible, which is a big plus in my book.

The practice staff seemed very friendly and welcoming, especially our receptionist who went out of her way to assist us. We felt at ease from the moment we walked in.

I recently had a terrible experience with the GP surgery, the receptionist was unfriendly and unhelpful, making it difficult for me to get an appointment on short notice.

The practice staff were very apologetic about the long waiting time, which seemed due to a technical issue. Our receptionist explained everything clearly, and we felt valued during our visit.

I found the GP surgery's reception staff to be extremely disorganised and unhelpful during my recent visit. They struggled to find my appointment details, which caused unnecessary delays.

The GP surgery has excellent reception staff who are always approachable and willing to help. I've had many visits here without any issues, thanks to their efficient service.

Unfortunately, my latest experience with the GP surgery was a disaster due to our receptionist's poor communication skills. She failed to inform us about an upcoming appointment, causing inconvenience to our daily routine.",positive,0.638582170009613,263.0,2,Reception Staff Interaction,disappointment,1,0.638582170009613,Reception Staff Interaction

"The GP surgery staff were friendly and helpful but struggled with keeping up with demand. The waiting room was always busy and seemed understaffed, leading to long waits for treatment.

However, when it came to discussing my vaccination schedule, I felt like the nurse seemed overwhelmed and didn't take the time to explain everything thoroughly.

I recently visited this GP surgery for a routine check-up and vaccinations, and overall, I was satisfied with the service. The receptionist was very friendly and made sure to check in with me frequently. However, when it came to administering the vaccinations themselves, the nurse seemed quite rushed and didn't seem to explain what was happening properly.

Unfortunately, my experience at this surgery was a bit of a letdown. I had been waiting for over an hour before seeing the doctor, which made me feel anxious and stressed. When I finally saw them, they barely looked up from their phone to speak with me, which didn't exactly fill me with confidence in the care provided.

The GP surgery staff were very welcoming and made sure I felt comfortable during my visit. The receptionist was friendly and efficient, and the nurse took the time to explain everything about my vaccinations. However, when it came to getting some follow-up advice on a minor issue, I had to wait for over 20 minutes before seeing the doctor.

I've been going to this surgery for years and have always been happy with the service. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable, and they make sure to keep me up-to-date on all my vaccinations. However, recently I did experience some long waiting times, which made me feel frustrated. Nevertheless, overall, I still highly recommend this surgery.

My visit to this GP surgery was a bit of a disaster. Not only were there long waiting times, but the staff seemed completely unorganized and disinterested in helping me.

The GP surgery staff were professional and courteous, and they made sure to explain everything about my vaccinations clearly.

"The GP surgery was very informative and helpful in explaining my diagnosis and treatment options. The receptionist made sure I had all the necessary paperwork done quickly and efficiently. However, it would have been better if they offered more support for those with mental health conditions like myself.

I recently visited this GP surgery for a routine check-up and found the staff to be somewhat unhelpful. The receptionist seemed distracted and didn't answer many of my questions properly.

The care and attention provided by this GP surgery is truly exceptional. From the moment I walked in, I felt seen and heard. The receptionist greeted me warmly, the doctor took time to listen to my concerns, and the nurse offered words of encouragement. Their expertise and kindness have given me renewed hope for my health.

Unfortunately, my experience at this GP surgery was marred by poor communication from the staff. When I expressed some anxiety about a procedure, they seemed put off and didn't provide adequate support. In contrast, when checking out, the receptionist was friendly and efficient.

I was quite disappointed with the overall quality of care at this GP surgery. The nurse seemed rushed and didn't take the time to explain my test results properly. Furthermore, the doctor's bedside manner left a lot to be desired, making me feel uncomfortable throughout our conversation. 

I recently had a great experience with this GP surgery due in part to their patient education programs. The receptionist made sure I was fully informed about my appointment and the treatments available for my condition. However, when issues arose during the visit, they seemed somewhat unprepared to handle them.

The staff at this GP surgery were friendly and welcoming from the start. The nurse was very kind and took great care in explaining everything that was happening. Unfortunately, I found their communication with other healthcare providers to be lacking, which caused some confusion during my follow-up appointment.

I recently had a concerning visit to the GP surgery due to chest pains. While the receptionist was helpful, the doctor didn't provide clear explanations of my condition and treatment options. They also seemed more interested in rushing me out than addressing all of my questions.

This GP surgery has made significant strides in patient education, which I appreciate greatly. The nurse explained everything about my medications in detail and offered advice on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. However, the waiting room could be improved by providing more comfortable seating options for patients who need to wait.

"The GP practice made me feel like just another number, not a person with my own story to tell. The receptionist was friendly but seemed distracted, and the nurse took ages to examine me, making me late for my appointment. I was told that everything would be fine but left feeling uncertain about the future of my health.

I had high hopes for this surgery after reading great reviews online. Unfortunately, my experience fell short of expectations. The staff were professional, but the doctor seemed overworked and rushed through our conversation. I couldn't help but feel like a priority wasn't being given to me, even though I was the only patient in the room. Despite that, I appreciated the nurse's kind demeanor.

I've been going to this GP surgery for years, and I must say, the practice has always treated my family well. The staff know us by name, and they always make sure we have a comfortable waiting area. The doctor is always willing to explain things in detail so that we can understand our treatment plan. Recently, however, I noticed that the receptionist seemed overwhelmed with new patients, which made me worry about the quality of care.

I was really looking forward to my appointment, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. The GP didn't take a thorough history, and I left feeling like I wasn't being heard. The nurse seemed nice, but she barely spoke to me, which made me feel isolated. It's disappointing when you're not treated with the respect you deserve from your healthcare team.

I recently had an excellent experience at this surgery, despite it being my first time visiting after a long absence. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted warmly by the receptionist and treated with kindness throughout the appointment. The doctor listened attentively to my concerns and provided me with clear explanations of my treatment plan. Overall, I'm so pleased with the level of care I received.

This surgery has been a constant source of frustration for me. Every time I visit, I feel like I'm being passed from one person to another without any follow-up or support. The doctor barely speaks to me, and the nurse seems uninterested in my concerns. It's disheartening when you're left feeling unheard and unsupported by your healthcare team.

I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to get an appointment at this surgery. The receptionist made check-in a breeze, and the waiting area was comfortable and clean. When I saw the doctor, they were kind and took the time to explain my treatment plan in detail. However, I do wish that there was more staff available during peak hours.

I've been seeing this GP for years, but recently, I noticed a significant decline in service quality. The receptionist is unfriendly, and the nurse seems distant. It's disappointing when you're not treated with the respect you deserve from your healthcare team. I hope they address these issues before it's too late.

The GP surgery provided excellent care during my recent appointment. However, what really stood out was the follow-up and continuity of care that occurred afterwards. The receptionist checked in with me regularly to ensure that everything was okay, and the nurse offered additional support when needed. It's clear that this practice values its patients beyond just providing basic medical care.

I visited this surgery for a routine check-up, but what I found was anything but routine. The GP seemed overwhelmed with new patients, which made my appointment feel rushed and disorganized. The nurse barely spoke to me, and the doctor barely explained my treatment plan. It's disappointing when you're not treated like a priority patient despite paying for your care.

This surgery has always provided me with excellent service. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and genuinely care about their patients' well-being. I've been seeing this GP for years and have never had any issues or concerns. The practice seems to prioritize its patients' needs above everything else.

Unfortunately, my recent experience at this surgery was a far cry from the high standards I've come to expect. The receptionist seemed distant, and the nurse took ages to examine me, making me late for my appointment. The doctor barely spoke to me, which made me feel unheard and unsupported. Despite that, I appreciate the practice's efforts to provide basic medical care.

I was thrilled with the level of care I received at this surgery. From the moment I arrived, I was treated like a person, not just another number. The receptionist was friendly, the nurse explained everything in detail, and the doctor took time to answer my questions. It felt like a breath of fresh air after dealing with other GP surgeries that have been less than satisfactory.

This surgery has always been my go-to for medical care. I've never had any issues or concerns, but my recent experience left me feeling disappointed. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed, and the nurse barely spoke to me.

It took over an hour just to get booked in for a routine check-up, which I had been putting off for months. The receptionist explained that they were short-staffed due to a recent illness among their team members. This seemed like a valid reason, but it would have been helpful if they could have communicated this better beforehand.

"Reception staff were friendly and helpful always making my visits stress free but on one occasion the nurse was a bit too hasty with the diagnosis I felt rushed out of the appointment which took me by surprise.

I recently had an experience with this GP surgery that left me feeling extremely frustrated. The receptionist barely acknowledged me when I checked in, and the nurse seemed to be in a rush to see her next patient. When I brought up my concerns about my condition, the doctor dismissed them without fully explaining what was wrong with me. It felt like they were not taking the time to listen to my needs.

I've been going to this GP surgery for years now and have always had positive experiences with the staff. The receptionist is always friendly and welcoming, making it easy to get an appointment at short notice. However, on one occasion I was seen by a different doctor who seemed uninterested in discussing my condition, which was a bit of a letdown.

The GP surgery has been great for me overall but recently had a disappointing experience with the nurse. When I first made contact, she seemed distant and didn't explain anything clearly about my appointment or what I could expect during it. However, once the doctor arrived, everything seemed to be fine and they were very caring and professional.

I visited this GP surgery last week for a routine check-up, and overall I was pleased with the service I received. The receptionist made sure I had an early appointment, which suited me just fine. When I met the nurse, she explained my test results clearly, but what really stood out was when the doctor came in to discuss everything further - they took the time to answer all my questions thoroughly.

Unfortunately, I had a bad experience at this GP surgery last month. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and rude, which put me on edge from the start. When I met with the nurse, she barely explained what was going on with my condition, just handed me some papers to read. To make matters worse, the doctor didn't seem interested in listening to my concerns.

I've had a mostly positive experience with this GP surgery over the years, but recently encountered an issue that left me feeling disappointed. The receptionist seemed disorganized and didn't explain much about what I could expect during my appointment. However, when the nurse arrived, everything was fine, and we discussed my condition thoroughly.

The GP surgery has been great for me in general but had one minor mishap with my recent visit. When I first made contact, the staff member seemed a bit too formal, which took away from my initial excitement to meet them. However, once they checked me in, everything ran smoothly and professionally as usual.

I had an appointment at 2 PM but when I arrived at 1:45 PM they didn't seem to have any doctors available until after 3 PM. The receptionist apologized and offered me a hot drink while I waited, which was the least they could do considering their lack of organization.

The GP surgery is one of my favorites - great appointment availability, friendly staff, and really reasonable prices. I've had several appointments here over the years and have always been impressed with how well-organized the practice is.

"The GP surgery was well-organized, with a clear waiting system, which allowed us to manage our time efficiently. However, the receptionist seemed overwhelmed at times, leading to delays in appointments. Despite this, the staff were always friendly and accommodating. Overall, I would recommend this surgery to others, but suggest they book an early morning appointment to avoid waiting. The facilities are clean and comfortable, making it a pleasant experience.

I recently had a very poor experience with this GP surgery. I had to wait for over an hour before being seen by the doctor, which was extremely frustrating. When my turn finally came, the nurse seemed completely uninterested in my concerns and barely asked me any questions. The GP was also rushed and didn't take much time to explain my diagnosis or treatment options. Overall, I would not recommend this surgery to anyone.

I have been attending this GP surgery for several years now, and overall, I have been very satisfied with the service provided. The staff are always polite and courteous, and they seem to genuinely care about their patients' well-being. One minor issue I do have is that sometimes it can be difficult to get an appointment at short notice, but when you do manage to book one, the receptionist makes sure everything runs smoothly.

I had a surprisingly positive experience with this GP surgery, despite having high expectations after reading some negative reviews online. The staff were friendly and welcoming from the moment I arrived, and they made me feel comfortable throughout my visit. However, the waiting area was quite small, and it took longer than expected to be seen by the doctor. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend this surgery to others.

I recently visited this GP surgery with a family member who is elderly, and unfortunately, we were both left feeling frustrated and disappointed with the experience. The receptionist seemed completely unorganized, and there was a long delay before being seen by the nurse. When my family member's turn finally came, the nurse barely spoke to them, and the GP seemed put off when asked questions about their treatment options. Overall, I would advise others to look for alternative surgeries.

I had an excellent experience with this GP surgery, which I highly recommend to anyone in need of medical attention. From the moment I arrived, I was treated with kindness and respect by the receptionist, who checked me in efficiently and quickly. The nurse was also very friendly and explained my diagnosis and treatment options clearly. However, one minor issue is that the waiting area could be improved, as it felt a bit cramped and uncomfortable at times.

Unfortunately, our experience at this GP surgery was marred by poor communication from the receptionist, who seemed completely disorganized and uninterested in helping us with our queries. The waiting time was also excessively long, which added to my frustration. Despite this, the doctor did seem professional and competent when we finally saw them. I hope they address these issues before more patients are affected.

I recently had a mixed experience at this GP surgery. While the staff were generally friendly and welcoming, there seemed to be some underlying issues with the system that caused delays and inefficiencies. The waiting area was also quite cramped and uncomfortable, which made it difficult for my family member to feel relaxed during our visit. However, the doctor did seem knowledgeable and competent when they saw us, so I would still recommend this surgery to others.

I had a disappointing experience at this GP surgery due to the limited availability of appointments.

"The staff were helpful but forgot my test results.

I was made to feel like just another number, not a patient. The receptionist barely looked up from their phone as I explained my symptoms. It took multiple requests for them to send me a referral to the specialist I needed to see. The whole experience felt rushed and unprofessional. I ended up having to wait an extra week for my appointment because they couldn't find the file on time. I left feeling frustrated and disappointed that I had wasted so much of my time.

The nurse was friendly but seemed unsure about how to proceed with my treatment. The doctor explained everything in detail, which was a relief after the initial confusion. However, when it came to addressing my concerns, they seemed evasive rather than empathetic. Overall, while the staff were pleasant, I didn't feel like I received the level of care that I deserved.

I've been going to this surgery for years and have always had great experiences with the staff. They're knowledgeable, kind, and always make time for me. The waiting area is clean and comfortable, which makes a big difference when you're already feeling anxious or unwell. The receptionist is friendly and efficient, and the doctors are always willing to listen to my concerns. I've recommended this surgery to all my friends and family because of their exceptional care.

I was really disappointed with the follow-up care after my operation. The nurse seemed more interested in rushing me out of the room than checking on how I was recovering. It took multiple calls to get someone to return my messages, which made me feel like they weren't taking my concerns seriously. When I finally got an appointment with a specialist, they barely looked at my notes and didn't ask any questions about my symptoms.

I had a great experience at this surgery initially, but the follow-up care has been a different story. After my initial consultation, I felt seen and heard by the doctor and nurse. However, since then, I've had to chase up my test results multiple times because they seem to have forgotten or misplaced them. It's frustrating because I feel like I'm being taken for granted as a patient.

The staff at this surgery are always friendly and welcoming. They make an effort to get to know me and understand my concerns. However, during my last visit, I felt like my symptoms were being brushed off rather than taken seriously.

I've been dealing with chronic pain for years, and this surgery has been a lifesaver. However, when it comes to follow-up care, I sometimes feel like I'm being forgotten about.

The GP practice has always been reliable for me, but the follow-up care could be improved. Sometimes I feel like my medication isn't being adjusted properly to manage my symptoms.

I've been going to this GP surgery for a while now and have always found them to be very caring and professional. They take the time to listen to your concerns and answer all your questions thoroughly. The receptionist is always friendly and welcoming, making you feel at ease from the moment you arrive. I highly recommend them to anyone in need of medical care.

I recently had a good experience with this GP surgery. However, there was one nurse who seemed completely unprofessional and dismissive.

"Reception staff were friendly but slow to attend to me. The waiting room was cramped and outdated, which wasn't ideal for a long-term condition check-up. Overall it felt like they prioritized efficiency over patient comfort, which I found frustrating. Despite this, the doctor was knowledgeable and thorough. However, the follow-up appointment time didn't get confirmed until after the visit ended, leaving me to wait another few weeks before getting my test results.

The GP surgery is convenient for those with no transport issues but not ideal for public transport users due to limited bus services nearby. Some of the staff seemed overworked and stressed, which made the experience less enjoyable. The clinic was clean and well-organized, but I found it quite difficult to get through on the phone during office hours. My appointment time was 10 minutes off as requested but the waiting room had only one chair available, leaving me with nowhere to sit.

I recently started attending this GP surgery due to its proximity to my workplace, which makes it a convenient option for me. The staff were kind and welcoming, especially the receptionist who checked in all patients efficiently. However, I did have to wait about 20 minutes before seeing the doctor, which was a bit longer than expected. Overall, it's a great service but perhaps could be improved by having more chairs available in the waiting room.

The GP surgery is easily accessible by public transport and has ample parking options for those without mobility issues. The staff were very helpful and accommodating during my visit. However, I found the waiting room to be quite uncomfortable due to outdated furniture and a lack of amenities such as refreshments or Wi-Fi. The appointment scheduling process was also a bit confusing.

I have been attending this GP surgery for some time now and generally find it to be reliable. The staff are polite and professional, and the clinic itself is well-maintained. However, on my most recent visit, I experienced some difficulty in getting through on the phone during office hours due to long waiting times. Overall, I would still recommend this GP surgery for its convenience and accessibility.

I recently had a negative experience at this GP surgery which left me feeling disappointed and frustrated. The receptionist seemed uninterested in my concerns, and the nurse appeared rushed throughout our appointment. Furthermore, the doctor's availability was limited, forcing us to wait unnecessarily for several weeks. It would be beneficial if they could improve their communication regarding appointment schedules.

The GP surgery has a convenient location but unfortunately, it can get quite busy during peak hours.

The doctor's note was sent to me promptly and I was able to access it easily from my phone. Overall experience was good but room for improvement.

I found the telehealth service to be really frustrating, had to wait over an hour for my call back and the nurse seemed uninterested in my symptoms, kept interrupting me and wouldn't answer all my questions. The doctor's appointment was rescheduled twice without any notification from the surgery. Really disappointed with the lack of communication.

The GP surgery's telehealth service was really convenient, able to book an appointment online and have it done from the comfort of my own home, nurse was very knowledgeable and helpful. The only issue I had was with the audio quality which kept dropping out but that was easily resolved by the nurse. Overall a great experience.

I recently tried the GP surgery's telehealth service for the first time and had a really bad experience, staff were unhelpful and unprofessional, kept putting me on hold and wouldn't answer my questions, felt like I was just an automated system to them.

The receptionist was very patient with me and made sure to address all my queries before sending me on my way. I also appreciated the doctor's kindness and willingness to listen to my concerns.

The waiting room could be improved as it seemed to lack adequate seating for its size, but the staff were always polite and courteous. On that particular day, the GP surgery was understaffed due to a severe weather warning, which significantly impacted our wait time. Thankfully, the doctor made up for this by allocating more time with each patient.

I recently had a poor experience at this GP surgery, primarily due to the long waiting period I endured on that morning.

"The reception staff were very friendly and helpful during my visit. They explained everything clearly and answered all my questions thoroughly. The process was smooth, and I felt at ease throughout the experience.

I recently visited this GP surgery for a check-up, but unfortunately, the receptionist seemed put off by me even before I had a chance to explain what I needed. Despite the initial awkwardness, they eventually got everything sorted out, which is more than I can say for some other surgeries I've been to.

Unfortunately, my experience was marred by unprofessional behavior from the staff at this GP surgery. The receptionist was dismissive and unfriendly, making me feel unwelcome from the moment I walked in. I was asked several questions about what brought me in but didn't receive any explanation of the services or procedures they provided. It was a disappointing experience overall.

The GP surgery was a bit chaotic during my visit, with long wait times for both the reception and nurse. The reception staff seemed overwhelmed, which might have contributed to some delays.

This GP surgery had all the hallmarks of an efficient well-run practice, starting with a friendly receptionist who greeted me warmly and made check-in a breeze.

I've been visiting this GP for years and have always found them to be professional and respectful, but my most recent visit fell short. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and had trouble managing the queue, while the nurse did her best to attend to me despite the chaos. Unfortunately, I didn't feel seen or heard during my appointment.

The staff at this surgery are usually very welcoming, but my latest experience was a letdown.

"I recently visited this GP surgery with a friend for a routine check-up and was impressed by how organized and efficient it was. The receptionist was friendly and checked us in quickly, making sure we had all the necessary paperwork done before our appointments.

However, during my actual appointment, I felt like I was just a number on their radar rather than an individual patient. They barely took notes or asked questions about my symptoms, which left me feeling somewhat unattended to.

But what really stood out to me was when I was called in for follow-up tests a few weeks later - the entire team was still as kind and understanding as they were on the first visit. The nurse even phoned me at home to explain the results in detail, addressing all my concerns and worries.",positive,0.8886973261833191,138.0,3,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,neutral,1,0.8886973261833191,Follow-up and Continuity of Care

"The GP surgery was surprisingly thorough with my test results. The lab technician explained everything clearly and provided a detailed breakdown of my readings.

"The staff were very helpful and kind but the waiting time was extremely long.

I had a mixed experience with the surgery, the receptionist was friendly but seemed overwhelmed which put me on edge. The nurse took the time to answer all my questions and explained everything clearly, however I did feel like they were being rushed during the procedure. Overall it was a good visit but I would have liked more information about what was happening throughout the process.

I recently had an appointment at this surgery and was disappointed by the overall experience. The receptionist seemed completely disorganized and unprepared for my arrival. However, the nurse who came to see me was very kind and caring, which made a big difference in how I felt during that time. Despite this positive interaction with one member of staff, I would not recommend this surgery due to the poor organization and lack of communication from the receptionist.

The GP practice seemed professional but lacked a personal touch. The nurse was friendly but didn't take the time to explain my test results thoroughly. However, the doctor who saw me took an interest in my health concerns and explained everything in detail. Overall it was a good visit but I felt like I was just another number rather than a patient.

I had a very positive experience at this surgery, from the moment I arrived I was treated with kindness and professionalism. The receptionist greeted me warmly, the nurse explained everything in detail, and the doctor took time to answer my questions. The waiting room was also comfortable and well-stocked with magazines and refreshments. Overall it was a fantastic visit that exceeded my expectations.

I had mixed feelings about my recent visit to this surgery. On the one hand, the receptionist was extremely friendly and made check-in easy. However, I felt like they were being very secretive about my medical history and didn't explain anything in detail. The nurse seemed rushed and the doctor barely spoke to me, which left me feeling frustrated and unheard.

I recently had a terrible experience at this surgery due to poor staff behavior.

I had a positive interaction with the GP practice staff, but it was somewhat marred by a lengthy wait for my appointment. The receptionist provided clear instructions and made check-in easy. Once I saw the doctor, however, they seemed to be more focused on their phone than our conversation.

Unfortunately, my visit to this GP surgery was not as impressive as I had hoped. The staff seemed overwhelmed, with multiple people rushing around at once.

"Excellent follow-up care from the GP practice, they called me within an hour of my appointment to check on my treatment progress. The nurse was very attentive and explained everything clearly.

The staff at this surgery are friendly but a bit disorganized at times, which can make the waiting experience quite long. However, the doctor always makes time for you and is extremely knowledgeable about their field. I've been going here for years now and feel that it's become my go-to healthcare provider. The GP practice is very understanding of its patients' needs and works hard to accommodate their schedules.

I was really disappointed with the follow-up care I received from this surgery, which left me feeling frustrated and unheard. I had asked several questions about my treatment during our initial consultation, but they were barely addressed by the doctor on my next visit. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and apologetic, but it didn't make up for the lack of attention to detail.

The GP practice provided excellent follow-up care after my surgery, which was a relief to experience.

The nurse even followed up with me at home to ensure everything was okay. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the level of care I received.

I recently visited this surgery for a follow-up appointment, but unfortunately, the experience was a letdown.

"Staff were friendly and welcoming but the waiting time was excessive and frustrating. 
Receptionist was apologetic about the delay, explaining it was due to a medical emergency that required urgent attention. I was kept updated throughout the process.

I had mixed feelings about my visit.

I had an excellent experience at this surgery, thanks to the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. From the receptionist to the nurse and finally the doctor, everyone went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and at ease. They explained everything clearly and thoroughly, answering all my questions and addressing all my concerns. I would highly recommend this surgery to anyone looking for excellent care.

The waiting room was tiny and cramped, with uncomfortable chairs that looked like they'd been there for decades. Despite this, the staff were friendly and apologetic about the inconvenience. The receptionist offered me a cup of tea and some biscuits while I waited, which made the experience slightly more bearable. However, when my appointment finally came around, I was kept waiting for over 20 minutes without any explanation.

I have mixed feelings about my recent visit to this surgery. On the one hand, the staff were friendly and welcoming, with the receptionist explaining everything in detail about the appointment process. However, when I asked for some additional information about my condition, she seemed rather dismissive and kept putting me off until the doctor's consultation. The waiting time was also quite long, which added to my frustration.

The staff at this surgery seem completely uninterested in providing good care for their patients. The receptionist barely acknowledged me when I arrived, and the nurse seemed put off by my presence throughout our conversation. When I asked to speak with a doctor, she told me it would have to wait until the next available slot, which was an hour later than originally scheduled. Not impressed.

"Reception staff were friendly but forgot my appointment twice. The nurse seemed busy with other patients and didn't explain the test results clearly.

I was pleased with the follow-up care I received after my initial visit. The GP took the time to review my test results and discuss any concerns or changes.

I found the nurse who attended to me to be quite unprofessional, constantly interrupting me mid-sentence and failing to take detailed notes about my medical history. 

From the moment I arrived for my appointment, the receptionist was warm and courteous, which put me at ease.

I was really disappointed with the reception staff's attitude when I called in sick. They seemed put off by having to take my appointment and didn't even offer to make it a phone call instead of coming into the surgery. It was a big letdown after hearing good things about this practice beforehand.

The waiting room was spotless, but that was where the positives ended. The receptionist kept interrupting me every time I tried to ask questions or provide my details, making me feel rushed and disorganized. I had to repeat myself multiple times just to get them to understand what I needed.

I recently had a good experience with this GP surgery's reception staff. They were very efficient and accommodating, checking in quickly without any issues. The office was also well-maintained, which gave me confidence that my health would be taken seriously.

The GP practice I visit seems to have its issues with the reception staff. While they're generally friendly, there was a moment where one seemed overwhelmed by multiple patients at once and snapped when I asked about wait times. It made for an uncomfortable situation, but I'm trying not to let it sway my opinion of the entire surgery.

Unfortunately, my most recent visit had some issues with the reception staff's professionalism. They were inattentive and didn't seem to care about addressing my concerns as a patient. The long wait time didn't help either, which made me feel frustrated.

The GP surgery has good staff members, but there are times when the reception team falls short. In this instance, I found them dismissive of my situation and lacking in empathy. This experience left me feeling unheard and unsupported.

I recently had a mixed experience with this GP practice's reception staff. While they were welcoming at first, their efficiency dropped off significantly once we started discussing my health concerns. It felt like they were prioritizing paperwork over patient care, which was disconcerting.

I found the staff quite dismissive and uninterested in my concerns. The receptionist barely acknowledged me, and the nurse seemed rushed. They didn't take the time to explain everything clearly. I felt like I was just another patient. Not impressed with the level of care provided.

The GP and nurses were super friendly and welcoming from start to finish. The receptionist had a smile on her face at all times and made sure we had everything we needed. The nurse explained my treatment options in detail and answered all our questions. The doctor took time to speak with us and address any concerns. Great experience overall.

"The GP practice made me feel comfortable with their patient-centered approach and thorough explanation of my test results. The lab report revealed some concerning patterns, which were addressed by the doctor during our discussion. However, I was disappointed to learn that no medication options could be prescribed without further testing.

I found the staff quite dismissive and uninterested in my concerns. The receptionist barely acknowledged me, and the nurse seemed rushed. When I expressed frustration with the lack of communication about my test results, the doctor simply told me they were ""not ready yet."" Not exactly reassuring when dealing with potentially serious health issues.

From the moment I arrived, I was treated with kindness and professionalism. The receptionist greeted me warmly, the nurse explained everything in detail, and the doctor took time to answer my questions. My lab results showed a clear indication of an underlying condition that could be managed effectively with medication and lifestyle changes. Unfortunately, it seems the practice doesn't have any on-staff specialists.

I was pleasantly surprised by how professional and caring the staff were. The receptionist made check-in easy, and the nurse was incredibly kind. However, after waiting for over 30 minutes to discuss my test results, I felt like I'd wasted valuable time. It would be helpful if they could provide a more detailed summary of my lab findings in advance.

The entire experience felt chaotic. The receptionist was overwhelmed and rude, the nurse seemed uninterested, and the doctor barely spoke to me. I left feeling unheard and disappointed. When I asked about the status of my test results, I was told it would take ""a few days"" – an unhelpful response given the urgency of the situation.

I had a generally positive experience with this GP surgery. The staff were friendly, efficient, and made sure everything ran smoothly during my visit. However, when discussing my lab results, I found it difficult to understand the full implications of the test results due to limited explanation by the nurse. Would be great if they could provide more detailed summaries.

The practice took an excessively long time to obtain my test results. The waiting room was cramped and poorly maintained, which didn't exactly contribute to a relaxing atmosphere. After finally receiving the lab report, I was relieved but also frustrated that no one had bothered to inform me of any concerns or potential issues beforehand.

I recently visited this GP surgery for some routine check-ups. Overall, my experience was pleasant and stress-free, thanks in large part to their patient-centric approach. However, when it came to interpreting my lab results with the doctor, I felt a bit lost due to her focus on general explanations rather than specifics about what those test results meant.

I recently had an appointment at this surgery for some routine blood work. Unfortunately, the nurse who administered the tests seemed rather uninterested in ensuring that everything went smoothly and was willing to disregard my concerns. As a result, I left feeling uneasy and a bit concerned about the accuracy of the lab results.

The GP practice provided me with excellent care during my recent visit. The staff were extremely welcoming and accommodating throughout my stay. My test results showed some promising signs of improvement in my condition, which was reassuring to hear. Nonetheless, it would have been helpful if they could also provide some more detailed information about what this means for my future treatment options.

The GP practice's waiting area was poorly ventilated and smelled strongly of stale air. During my visit, the staff seemed somewhat disorganized and overwhelmed by the sheer volume of patients. When discussing my test results, I found it difficult to get any clear answers from either the nurse or doctor due to their apparent distraction.

The receptionist is warm and welcoming, making me feel at ease from the moment I step inside. From the check-in process to the doctor's consultations, everything has been top-notch. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars was that I had to wait for over an hour before being seen, but even that wasn't too bad considering the exceptional care I received afterwards.

The staff at this surgery are generally very professional, though some days they can be a bit gruff. I've noticed that some of them seem to be having a tough time dealing with the high volume of patients, which is understandable given the busy schedule they keep. However, it's disappointing when you see a staff member who clearly cares about their job slipping up and showing signs of frustration. On the other hand, there are others like receptionist Jane who always greet me warmly and make sure I have everything I need before my appointment. Despite some minor missteps, I've generally been very satisfied with the level of care I've received here.

I recently had a rather disappointing experience at this surgery. The waiting room was chaotic, with patients milling about and no one seeming to be paying attention to anyone in particular. When it finally was time for my appointment, I was told that there would be some delay due to a prior emergency, which was not exactly reassuring. My doctor did eventually see me, but the whole process felt rushed and impersonal. The staff seemed overwhelmed and stressed out, and I couldn't help but feel like I was just another number in their busy schedule rather than an actual patient with needs and concerns.

The surgery is run by a lovely woman named Karen who always takes care of me, making sure my appointments are scheduled correctly and that everything runs smoothly. The staff at this place are absolutely top-notch - friendly, professional, and genuinely caring. They go above and beyond to make sure you feel comfortable and supported during your visit. Even when I've had minor issues with my appointments, the receptionist has always been happy to help resolve the problem and get me back on track.

I was really impressed with the staff at this surgery - they were all incredibly friendly and welcoming, making a difficult experience much easier. The waiting room could have been cleaner, but that's about it, and I didn't notice anything else out of the ordinary. My nurse, Rachel, took a lot of time to explain everything in detail and made sure I understood what was going on with my health. The receptionist also seemed very knowledgeable and helpful.

The practice is generally well-run, although there have been some days when it feels like they're understaffed. On those occasions, the waiting times can be quite long, which isn't ideal. However, the staff do their best to make up for it, often staying with patients for longer periods of time to ensure everyone gets seen. My favorite member of staff has got to be Emma, the receptionist - she's always cheerful and makes me feel like I'm in good hands.

The surgery is run by a team that seems to genuinely care about their patients. The waiting room could use some updating, but overall the place feels clean and well-maintained. My experience with this practice has been overwhelmingly positive - from the check-in process to the doctor's consultations, everything has felt professional, friendly, and respectful.

It's been an absolute pleasure dealing with the staff at this surgery - they're all so warm, welcoming, and genuinely interested in your health. The waiting room is sometimes a bit chaotic, but that's just a minor quibble when you consider how well the actual appointments are run. From the nurse who explained everything to me in detail to the receptionist who made sure I had all my paperwork sorted out before I left, everyone has been nothing short of fantastic.

I was thoroughly unimpressed with this surgery - the waiting room was a disaster, and it took ages to get seen by the doctor.

The reception staff are always cheerful and accommodating, and they've even offered to book my appointments on my behalf when I'm running late or forgetful. I do wish there was a slightly more streamlined process for dealing with minor issues, but overall, it's been an excellent experience.

I have mixed feelings about the GP surgery I recently visited. On one hand, the reception staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, which set a positive tone for my visit. However, during the consultation itself, I felt like I was being rushed through and didn't get the full explanation I needed from the doctor. Furthermore, the practice's online portal is still in its infancy and can be frustrating to use at times. Despite this, the GP did seem genuinely concerned about my condition, so that boded well for future follow-ups.

The GP surgery has been a revelation for me - after dealing with numerous health issues and mediocre care elsewhere, I've finally found a practice that truly cares about its patients. The staff are always cheerful and accommodating, and they take the time to explain everything in detail. The doctor is knowledgeable and approachable, and the receptionist is incredibly efficient. I especially appreciate how well-organized their system is for keeping track of patient records.

I visited this GP surgery on a last-minute basis due to an unexpected medical issue, and while it was a bit chaotic at times, the staff did a commendable job in getting me seen and treated promptly. However, when I followed up with my doctor after leaving, I felt like I wasn't really being heard or acknowledged - there seemed to be a disconnect between the front-of-house staff and the actual clinicians. Still, overall, it's been a decent experience so far.

I was really impressed by the GP surgery's approach to follow-up care - from the moment I made my first appointment, I knew that I was in good hands. The reception staff are always warm and welcoming, and they took the time to answer all my questions before my initial consultation. After that, the GP kept in close touch with me via phone and email to monitor my progress and address any concerns I had. Overall, a fantastic experience that left me feeling confident in their ability to provide excellent care.

I have a love-hate relationship with this GP surgery - on one hand, they've always been there for me when I need them, but on the other, I sometimes feel like I'm being treated like just another number rather than an actual person. The staff are friendly enough, but sometimes it feels like they're phoning it in or not really listening to what you have to say. Still, overall, they've been a reliable source of medical care for me over the years.

I recently visited this GP surgery with a long-standing condition that's required ongoing management, and while I was pleased to see that my GP took my concerns seriously, I couldn't help but feel like there wasn't enough follow-up support offered by the practice. Specifically, I felt like I needed more regular check-ins and monitoring of my condition to ensure it didn't deteriorate further. That being said, the GP did seem genuinely invested in my well-being, so fingers crossed that things will improve moving forward.

I recently had a great experience with this GP surgery - from the moment I made my first appointment, everything ran smoothly and efficiently. The reception staff were friendly and welcoming, and the nurse took the time to explain everything in detail before the doctor arrived.

I'm not one for writing reviews, but I feel compelled to give this GP surgery a shout-out because of their incredible follow-up care. From the moment I left the consultation room after having a minor health scare, the staff checked in on me via phone and email to make sure I was okay. They even offered to book me an appointment with my GP if I needed further treatment! It's been a really reassuring experience overall.

The GP surgery has been quite hit-or-miss for me - sometimes it feels like they're doing everything right, but other times I feel like I'm just being poked and prodded without any real attention to detail. On the plus side, they've always got plenty of availability, which is a definite bonus! And when I have issues with my medication or need additional follow-up care, I appreciate how responsive they are.

The GP surgery has been a mixed bag for me over the years - sometimes I feel like they're doing great things, but other times it feels like they're just phoning it in. That being said, when I do have issues with my health, I appreciate how responsive and caring the staff are. They always seem to be willing to go above and beyond to help me out.

I'm not thrilled about this GP surgery, to be honest - while they've always been available for me when I need them, I sometimes feel like I'm being treated more like a machine than an actual person. The reception staff can come across as a bit dismissive at times, which is off-putting. However, I do appreciate how well-organized their system is for keeping track of patient records.

"The GP surgery staff were efficient and friendly, making my appointment wait time reasonable. The receptionist was helpful and explained everything clearly. Overall, a very positive experience despite some initial concerns about availability. However, I did notice on one occasion the waiting area was almost empty but no one seemed to be attending to it. I'm glad the GP took the time to speak with me and address my health concerns. The practice seems well-organized, and I would definitely recommend them.

I've been waiting for an appointment at this surgery for weeks, only to be told that there are still openings available, which is a complete joke. Every time I call, they just put me on hold for ages before finally booking a slot, even when they claim the practice is fully booked. It's frustrating and unprofessional.

My experience with this GP surgery was overwhelmingly positive from start to finish. The receptionist made it easy to check in, the nurse explained everything clearly, and the doctor took time to answer my questions. I was also impressed by how organized the waiting area was, with clear signage and comfortable seating. Overall, a great visit.

The GP surgery staff were friendly and professional during my appointment, but what really stood out was their availability. After struggling to get an appointment for weeks, I finally got through on short notice, which was incredibly convenient. The receptionist even offered to book me in for the next available time slot if anything came up between then.

Unfortunately, my experience at this GP surgery was a mixed bag. While the staff were kind and knowledgeable, the practice's booking system is complete chaos. I've had to call multiple times before finally getting an appointment, and even then, I was told that they couldn't accommodate me during the time slot I requested due to 'unforeseen circumstances.' It's disorganized and frustrating.

I recently moved to a new area and needed to find a GP surgery for my needs. I'm pleased to say that this practice exceeded my expectations in every way. The receptionist was warm and welcoming, the nurse explained everything clearly, and the doctor took time to answer all my questions. One thing that really impressed me was how easily they accommodated my schedule – I had an emergency appointment scheduled at short notice.

The GP surgery staff were generally helpful, but the real problem lay with their availability. Despite claiming the practice is fully booked, I've found myself waiting for hours on multiple occasions before being seen by a doctor.

"The GP surgery staff were efficient but unfriendly, making my appointment feel rushed. The receptionist barely acknowledged me as I waited for what felt like an eternity before being called in to see the doctor.

I had high expectations for this GP surgery due to its proximity to my home and online booking system. Unfortunately, my experience was underwhelming. The waiting room was cramped and uncomfortable, with stale air and dirty magazines. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and disorganized, taking ages to find my appointment and then rushing me in without any explanation.

I recently had a mixed experience at this GP surgery. On the one hand, the staff were very knowledgeable about health issues and took the time to explain everything in detail. The doctor was particularly kind and caring, which made a huge difference in my overall satisfaction. However, I felt that some of the administrative tasks were handled poorly, such as checking in for my appointment.

I have been attending this GP surgery for several years now, and while it has its ups and downs, the staff generally do their best to accommodate patients with busy schedules. The receptionist often seems understaffed, but they usually manage to get me in quickly enough when I need an urgent appointment. Overall, my experience has been positive, but there have been times when I felt rushed or neglected.

The GP surgery was a pleasant surprise after experiencing subpar medical care elsewhere. From the moment I walked in, I felt at ease with the receptionist's warm smile and friendly demeanor. The nurse took the time to explain everything clearly, and the doctor listened attentively to my concerns. However, there were some issues with appointment availability that prevented me from getting in sooner.

I was quite disappointed with this GP surgery, primarily due to the limited availability of appointments outside of peak hours. Despite having a valid reason for seeking medical attention during an off-peak time slot, I was told that it would be too late by the receptionist and had to wait until the next available appointment - which wasn't until several days later.

The GP surgery's online booking system is user-friendly, but the availability of appointments can be limited at times. On my last visit, I booked an appointment for a specific time slot only to find that it was taken by someone else.

To make matters worse, the doctor didn't even bother to come out of their office to speak with me.

I had a good experience with my GP surgery, but there were some issues. The staff seemed friendly and efficient, but the waiting time was long - over an hour for just a routine check-up.

The nurse's empathetic nature put me at peace, allowing me to focus on what mattered most - getting better.

"The GP practice seems understaffed and disorganized. 

I was impressed by how quickly the nurse attended to my appointment, but the receptionist appeared overwhelmed.

From a bad experience with a previous doctor, I was cautious about visiting this surgery again, but the staff were friendly and welcoming. However, it took an excessive amount of time before I was seen by the doctor. The waiting room was also uncomfortably warm.

Unfortunately, my visit to the GP practice was let down by unprofessional behavior from one of the receptionists. Despite being told that a doctor would be with me shortly, they spent most of their time on their phone rather than attending to patients.

I recently visited this GP surgery and had mixed feelings about my experience. The staff were generally friendly, but the waiting room was poorly maintained, and there was no clear indication of when appointments would start.

The GP practice seems to be understaffed at times, which can lead to long wait times for patients like myself who require urgent attention. However, the staff do seem to care about their patients' well-being, and I appreciate that they take the time to explain diagnoses and treatment options in a clear and concise manner.

I was disappointed by the service provided by this GP surgery, particularly when it came to communication.

"The GP practice staff were extremely polite and helpful during my visit. The receptionist efficiently handled the initial paperwork, and the nurse provided clear explanations for each test result.

I found the waiting room to be tidy and comfortable, which put me at ease. However, I felt that some of the staff seemed overworked, leading to a sense of chaos in the practice. Overall, my experience was generally positive, but there were moments where I felt like I was being rushed through the appointment. Despite this, the doctor provided thorough explanations for my diagnosis and treatment options.

The GP surgery left a great impression on me due to its organized and respectful atmosphere. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted warmly by the receptionist and shown to a clean and comfortable waiting area.

The GP practice staff were very friendly and accommodating during my visit. However, I felt that some of them seemed to be in a rush, which put me on edge at times.

Unfortunately, my recent visit to this GP practice left a sour taste in my mouth.

"The reception staff were friendly and helpful, making my visit very pleasant. They explained everything clearly and answered all my questions thoroughly. 

I had a mixed experience with the reception staff, they were generally polite but sometimes seemed overwhelmed which made it difficult to get the attention I needed.

Our GP practice is lucky to have such a warm and welcoming front desk team, who make you feel at ease from the moment you walk in, and go above and beyond to accommodate your needs. 

The receptionist was completely unhelpful, refusing to book my appointment or answer any of my questions, leaving me feeling frustrated and ignored.

Our experience at this surgery was fantastic, we were greeted with a warm smile by the receptionist who went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and explained everything clearly in simple terms. 

I had a terrible experience with the reception staff, they seemed completely uninterested in my concerns and barely acknowledged me, making me feel dismissed and unheard.

The GP practice has undergone significant changes recently and unfortunately this is reflected in their reception area, where I was met with a disorganised and unfriendly staff member who seemed more interested in checking her phone than dealing with patients.",positive,0.9217039346694946,208.0,3,Reception Staff Interaction,disappointment,1,0.9217039346694946,Reception Staff Interaction
"The GP practice provided a helpful service, although somewhat slow. The waiting area was out of date, but the staff were friendly and willing to answer questions. On my first visit, I felt rushed through, but subsequent appointments were more relaxed. However, when discussing a serious concern with a nurse, I found them dismissive of my fears. Thankfully, another doctor saw me afterwards and provided more support. Overall, it's an okay practice for basic check-ups, but some improvement is needed for complex mental health issues. The staff seems to be learning from past experiences, so perhaps things will get better in the future.

I was thoroughly disappointed with my experience at this GP surgery. They failed to address my concerns about anxiety and depression, instead giving me a quick prescription without even asking follow-up questions. I had to repeatedly schedule appointments just to get someone who seemed willing to listen. The waiting area is cramped and outdated, making you feel uncomfortable while waiting for what feels like an eternity. When the doctor finally saw me, they barely acknowledged my issues and seemed more interested in discussing their own workload than helping me. This experience left a sour taste in my mouth and I will be seeking alternative care for my mental health needs.

The GP practice has been quite reliable for minor issues, but for serious concerns like anxiety and depression, it's a different story altogether. The staff seems to be struggling with the demands of treating complex mental health cases, which can make you feel unheard and unseen. On one occasion, I was seen by a nurse who seemed completely unprepared to deal with my situation, which made me feel even more anxious. However, when I returned for follow-up appointments, other staff members were kinder and more willing to listen. Despite this, the overall experience feels somewhat inconsistent.

I recently had an appointment at this GP surgery for anxiety-related issues and was relieved that they took it seriously from the start. The receptionist made check-in easy, and the nurse provided a lot of reassurance before the doctor saw me. My concerns were heard clearly, and I received clear guidance on managing my symptoms. One minor issue I had with the experience was the waiting area, which felt cramped at times. Overall, however, this GP practice seems to be doing its best to address mental health issues.

The reception staff were kind and welcoming when I visited the surgery for a routine check-up, but what really impressed me was the level of care shown by the nurse who saw me. They took their time explaining my diagnosis and treatment options in detail, making sure I understood everything before moving on. The only reason I wouldn't give this GP practice a full 5 stars is that they don't seem to have any specific mental health resources available, which would be greatly beneficial for patients like myself who need ongoing support.

I was thoroughly frustrated with my experience at this GP surgery. They seemed completely overwhelmed and understaffed, which made me feel rushed through and unheard. The waiting area is tiny and out of date, and the staff barely acknowledged me before sending me to see a doctor. When I did finally get seen, the doctor seemed distracted and didn't seem to want to discuss my concerns in any depth. To make matters worse, they prescribed medication without asking about potential side effects or interactions. Overall, this GP practice seems more focused on dealing with mundane issues than addressing serious mental health concerns.

I recently had a positive experience at this GP surgery, which was a welcome change from some of the other practices I've visited. The staff were kind and welcoming, making me feel at ease as I discussed my anxiety-related issues. They took the time to listen to my concerns and provided clear guidance on managing my symptoms. One thing that impressed me about this practice is their commitment to providing mental health resources, including a dedicated therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders. Overall, I feel like I've finally found a GP surgery that truly understands the importance of addressing mental health.

The GP practice seemed somewhat disjointed during my visit for anxiety-related issues. The receptionist was friendly but seemed to be struggling with the demand on her alone, which made me wait a while before being seen. When I did get to speak with a nurse, they barely acknowledged my concerns and seemed more interested in discussing their own workload than helping me. However, when the doctor finally saw me, they were kind and understanding, and provided clear guidance on managing my symptoms. To improve the experience, I think this practice needs to work on addressing the administrative issues that seem to be causing delays.

"The GP surgery is a great place to take your family for regular check-ups, with friendly staff who always have a smile on their face. The waiting room is clean and comfortable, making it an ideal spot to wait while the nurse attends to someone else's appointment. The receptionist is very helpful in managing my schedule and answering any queries I may have before or after my visit.

I recently visited this GP surgery for some routine check-ups and was generally satisfied with the service provided by the staff. However, I did find it a bit challenging to get an appointment at short notice, which required me to book well in advance. Despite this, the receptionist helped me find a suitable time slot, and the nurse and doctor were very caring during my visit.

Unfortunately, I had a disappointing experience at this GP surgery when I visited for some concerns about my health. The staff seemed rushed and disorganized, which made it difficult for them to attend to my needs properly. The receptionist was unfriendly, the nurse didn't explain my treatment clearly, and the doctor barely spoke to me. It was a frustrating experience that left me feeling unheard and unvalued.

"Staff were friendly but lost my notes.
They kept forgetting things during follow-ups.
I've been going to this surgery for years, but the consistency of care has decreased over time.
I initially had high hopes when I joined their practice, but unfortunately, those expectations haven't been met lately.
Reception staff are often inconsiderate and dismissive towards patients' concerns.
The nurse seemed more interested in chatting than attending to my condition.

"The GP practice provided adequate follow-up on my appointment, however, it took several calls to get a reasonable appointment time. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed with the number of patients. I appreciated the nurse's attention to detail during my consultation but felt rushed. Overall, the experience was satisfactory, but I would have liked more flexibility in scheduling.

I was really disappointed with the follow-up care after my recent surgery. Despite being told that someone from the practice would be in touch, weeks went by and I hadn't heard anything. The lack of communication made me feel like they had forgotten about me. When I finally got through to the receptionist, she seemed uninterested in addressing my concerns. It was a really frustrating experience.

The GP surgery provided excellent follow-up care after my initial consultation.

The staff were also very open and honest about what they knew and didn't know, which put me at ease. I felt like I received comprehensive and personalized care.

I've been going to this GP surgery for a few years now and have always found the follow-up care to be top-notch. Despite my busy schedule, I never feel rushed or ignored during appointments.

I recently had a negative experience with this GP surgery's follow-up care. After an emergency appointment, I was left feeling dismissed and unimportant. The nurse seemed inattentive and didn't address my concerns or provide any clear explanation of my condition. When I followed up with the receptionist, she was also unhelpful. I felt like I had been treated as just another number rather than a patient.

The GP surgery's follow-up care is one area where they really excel. From the initial consultation to ongoing check-ins, every member of staff made me feel heard and understood.

However, the delay was a significant inconvenience that I would have liked to avoid.

The GP surgery's appointment system is completely outdated and disorganized. It often takes weeks to get an appointment, and when you do finally receive one, it's usually for the wrong day or time. The staff seem overwhelmed and untrained to deal with this kind of pressure, but they always try their best to accommodate me despite these issues.

I was pleased with my recent visit to the GP surgery as I managed to get an appointment within a week of booking. However, when it came to discussing my condition, I felt that some aspects were glossed over and not fully explained by the doctor. The receptionist was friendly and helpful throughout the process, but I would have liked more time with my doctor.

The GP surgery's appointment availability is woefully inadequate. It usually takes me several weeks to secure an appointment, which is unacceptable for a patient who requires regular check-ups. The staff seem understaffed and overworked, leading to long wait times and a general air of disorganization.",negative,0.7720155119895935,355.0,4,Appointment Availability,disappointment,1,-0.7720155119895935,Appointment Availability

"The GP was informative but slightly dismissive when answering my questions about medication side effects.

I had mixed feelings about my experience at this surgery, with the receptionist being friendly but the nurse seeming rather stern. The doctor came in late, which made me feel like they were prioritizing other patients over me. On the plus side, the receptionist was very helpful in getting me checked in and explaining the waiting room procedure.

The GP practice took good care of my physical health, but fell short when it came to addressing my mental well-being concerns. The nurse seemed uninterested in discussing my anxiety, and the doctor barely had time to listen to my problems. Despite this, I appreciate the convenient appointment scheduling system they have in place.

I was disappointed with the lack of transparency regarding my test results and medication information. The receptionist promised to send me a summary of my visit within 24 hours, but it took several days for them to follow through. However, the actual consultation itself was quite thorough and engaging.

The staff at this surgery were friendly and welcoming, especially during check-in. However, I felt like they didn't take my concerns seriously when I discussed my chronic pain issues. The doctor seemed more focused on their own schedule than listening to my needs. Still, the waiting room had a pleasant atmosphere.

My experience was mixed - the GP practice is convenient and has a good reputation, but the service could be improved. The receptionist was polite, but seemed overwhelmed with tasks.

I had a mixed feeling about the staff's professionalism during my recent visit to GP surgery. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and stressed, while the nurse appeared competent and caring, but the doctor came across as somewhat dismissive. This inconsistency made me question their ability to provide comprehensive care. Despite this, I would still recommend them due to the excellent nursing service.

I've been going to this GP surgery for a few years now, and over time, I've noticed a noticeable improvement in staff professionalism. The receptionist is always cheerful and welcoming, the nurse is knowledgeable and patient, but sometimes the doctor can be a bit too abrupt. Overall, it's still a great experience, especially considering the long waiting times.

The GP surgery's staff were extremely friendly and approachable, which made my visit feel more like an appointment with friends than a medical consultation. However, there was one issue that really let them down - they didn't seem to have any proper medical records on me. Thankfully, the doctor was able to sort this out quickly, but it felt like a major oversight.

I recently had an excellent experience at my local GP surgery thanks largely to the professionalism and care shown by the staff. From check-in to check-out, everything went smoothly, with both the receptionist and nurse being incredibly friendly and helpful.

Unfortunately, my experience at this GP surgery was a complete letdown due to the staff's unprofessional behavior. When I presented my symptoms, the nurse seemed put off and made some dismissive comments. To make matters worse, the receptionist appeared completely uninterested in resolving my issue.

I had a bit of an awkward experience at this GP surgery, mainly due to the staff's lack of enthusiasm. When I arrived, the receptionist barely acknowledged me and the nurse seemed preoccupied.

"The GP practice has a good system for initial appointments, but follow-up care feels lacking. The receptionist is always friendly, but sometimes it takes too long to get seen for future appointments. I've had to wait over an hour some times, which can be frustrating. Despite this, the medical staff seem knowledgeable and take a genuine interest in my health.

I was impressed with the care I received from Dr. Smith on several occasions, however, the practice's follow-up policy has been inconsistent. They sometimes fail to send reminders for blood tests or other appointments, leading to missed opportunities for early intervention. This can be particularly concerning for people with chronic conditions. Overall, the practice shows promise, but needs to work on streamlining their follow-up processes.

The GP surgery has a great team of medical professionals who always explain my treatment options in detail. I recently had an issue with one of my medications and was impressed by how quickly the nurse and receptionist worked together to resolve it. The only area for improvement would be having more regular check-ups, as I feel like I'm being kept informed too much about my health.

I have mixed feelings about this GP surgery - while the staff are friendly and efficient, the follow-up care can be slow.

I've been going to this GP surgery for years and have always had a positive experience. The staff know me well and are always willing to listen and offer advice. They're very understanding of my busy schedule, and the appointments are often flexible. I feel confident in their ability to diagnose and treat my health issues.

Unfortunately, my last visit was a letdown. The receptionist seemed unfriendly and unapproachable, making it hard for me to get the information I needed.

I found the GP surgery's accessibility to be a major issue - they have a very small disabled parking space which can accommodate only one vehicle at a time. This makes it difficult for people who need to transfer from their car as part of the parking process, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience. The reception area could also benefit from more comfortable seating options and better lighting.

The receptionist was very welcoming and made sure I had all the necessary forms to fill out before my appointment. The waiting room was clean and comfortable, which is more than I can say for some other surgeries I've been to. Overall, it's a solid choice if you're looking for a GP in the area.

I recently had an excellent experience at this surgery. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted warmly by the receptionist and made to feel at ease. The nurse who attended me explained everything clearly and answered all my questions patiently. However, the doctor seemed rushed and didn't take as much time with me as I would have liked.

I was extremely disappointed with the service at this surgery. The staff were completely unhelpful and seemed put off by my presence from the moment I walked in. The receptionist barely acknowledged me and the nurse just went through the motions of checking my blood pressure without even looking up. To make matters worse, they ran over 30 minutes behind schedule.

I had a really positive experience at this GP surgery. From the start, I was treated with kindness and respect by the staff. The receptionist was friendly and efficient, the nurse explained everything in detail, and the doctor took time to answer all my questions. The waiting room was comfortable and there were tea and biscuits available, which made a big difference.

The experience at this surgery was mixed. On the one hand, I thought the staff were very professional and courteous. The receptionist checked me in quickly and efficiently, and the nurse who saw me was friendly and knowledgeable. However, when I asked about my test results, the doctor seemed evasive and didn't provide much detail.",positive,0.7661651968955994,323.0,2,Reception Staff Interaction,disappointment,1,0.7661651968955994,Staff Professionalism

"The reception staff were unfriendly and disorganized making my wait extremely long.
I had to repeat myself multiple times for them to take notes correctly, which was really frustrating.

"The reception staff were friendly and welcoming, making my visit feel less stressful. However, they seemed a bit disorganized, which added to the overall anxiety of waiting. It was an average experience overall. I would recommend this surgery to others, but with some caveats.

I had a very positive experience at the GP surgery due to one particular receptionist, who went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable. She checked in on me during my wait and even offered me a cup of water. The rest of the staff seemed busy or distracted, which made it hard for me to get the attention I needed. Nonetheless, the receptionist's kindness made up for everything.

The GP surgery was a disaster due to poor communication from the reception staff. They were completely unfriendly and unhelpful, making my visit feel like a chore. The nurse seemed overwhelmed and didn't know how to handle any of my concerns. It took me over an hour just to get in to see someone.

I recently had an excellent experience at this surgery thanks to an incredible receptionist who treated me with compassion and understanding.

"The GP practice provided adequate mental health support, but it felt impersonal. The receptionist was friendly, but the nurse seemed rushed and didn't take my concerns seriously. I was seen by a doctor who had little knowledge of anxiety disorders. I left feeling like my issues weren't being taken care of.

I recently had an appointment at this GP surgery for some mental health concerns. The staff were very welcoming and made me feel comfortable from the start. They listened attentively to what I had to say and provided excellent guidance on how to manage my symptoms. The doctor took a genuine interest in my well-being and answered all of my questions thoroughly.

I was extremely disappointed with the mental health support at this surgery. The receptionist seemed completely uninterested, and the nurse barely even looked at me before sending me straight to see the doctor. When I explained how I'd been feeling, the doctor just scribbled some notes on a piece of paper without really listening to what I had to say. It felt like my issues weren't being taken seriously.

The GP practice provided a safe and non-judgmental space for discussing mental health concerns. The staff were empathetic and understanding, taking the time to listen attentively to my experiences. The doctor was knowledgeable about various anxiety disorders and offered valuable insights into managing symptoms effectively.

Unfortunately, my experience at this surgery was marred by inefficiency and a lack of communication. I had to wait for an extended period before being seen by the nurse, who then seemed in a hurry to finish our appointment. When I brought up some concerns with the doctor, they barely listened and offered little in terms of support or guidance. Overall, it felt like my mental health needs weren't being met.

I've been seeing this GP for several years now, and their mental health support has always been top-notch. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and genuinely care about their patients' well-being. They listen attentively to our concerns, offer personalized advice, and provide excellent guidance on managing symptoms effectively. I couldn't recommend them more highly.

The receptionist at this GP surgery seemed completely overwhelmed, struggling to keep up with the demand for appointments. The nurse was friendly but seemed uninterested in my concerns, barely even making eye contact as we discussed my mental health issues. When I asked to speak to a doctor, I was told that they were ""unavailable"" and sent back out into the waiting room. It felt like my needs weren't being prioritized.

The GP practice takes its mental health support very seriously, providing a comprehensive range of services to cater to different patient needs. The staff are highly trained and empathetic, taking the time to listen attentively to our concerns and offering expert guidance on managing symptoms effectively.

"I had a mixed experience at this surgery. The receptionist was friendly but took ages to sort out my appointment, leaving me feeling fidgety for 20 minutes.

Unfortunately, the doctor seemed inconsiderate when I asked questions about my medication, barely giving me a moment of their time.

The staff were friendly but seemed to be struggling with the workload, which made the wait times longer than expected.

"The test results were as expected, a minor blood pressure increase which my doctor explained was due to stress from work. The diagnosis was straightforward and the nurse was very helpful in explaining what I needed to do to manage it. 

I was disappointed with how quickly they dealt with my concerns about the test results, the medical staff seemed more interested in rushing me through than addressing any worries I had.

The GP surgery provided accurate and comprehensive test results which helped us identify potential health issues earlier on. The doctor took the time to explain everything in detail, including treatment options and what to expect next. I was impressed by their level of care and attention to my needs. 

I found the test result report from this surgery unclear and hard to understand, it would be better if they could provide a clearer explanation.

The results were not as detailed as I had hoped for, but overall the experience with the GP surgery was still positive. The staff were friendly and helpful, even if some of my questions went unanswered. 

I was dissatisfied with the speed at which the test results were provided, it felt like they rushed through everything without giving me the time to ask all my questions.

The test results from this surgery were accurate but I was disappointed that I had to wait an hour just to get them. The staff seemed overwhelmed and disorganized which made for a stressful experience.
