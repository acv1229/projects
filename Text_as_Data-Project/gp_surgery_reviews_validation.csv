"Reception staff were friendly but often booked up.
Had to wait 20 minutes for appointment, which isn't ideal.
They did offer some rescheduling options and were willing to work around my schedule. Still, it would be great if there was more flexibility with appointments.
Perhaps adding a same-day option or a virtual consultation could help alleviate some of the pressure on the team.

"I found the GP surgery to be generally satisfactory. The reception staff were friendly and efficient, although it took a while to get seen by the doctor.

The medication management system was easy to navigate, but I did have some issues with refills being processed too slowly. Overall, I would recommend this surgery to others.

The staff were very helpful in managing my chronic condition, explaining everything clearly and making sure I understood my treatment plan. However, there was a long wait before seeing the doctor, which was frustrating at times. Despite this, they always made an effort to follow up with me after appointments.

I recently switched to this GP surgery from another one, and I'm so glad I did. The staff are incredibly welcoming and make you feel at ease right away. They also have a great system in place for getting prescriptions filled quickly and efficiently.

Unfortunately, my experience with this surgery has been mixed. While the receptionist was friendly and helped me check in, the actual consultation with the doctor was rushed and didn't really address all of my concerns. The medication management system seems to be in disarray at times, which can be frustrating when I need refills.

The GP I see there is very knowledgeable about my specific condition and has been a great advocate for me. However, the waiting room could be cleaner, and it would be nice if they had more seating options available.

"The staff were kind but overbooked and disorganized, leading to a rushed check-in and delayed treatment.

I was thoroughly impressed with the level of empathy shown by the receptionist. She took the time to listen to my concerns and offered words of encouragement when I was feeling anxious about my diagnosis. The nurse also demonstrated exceptional compassion, explaining everything in detail and addressing all my questions. However, despite the outstanding service provided, I felt a sense of frustration due to some minor administrative issues that were not fully resolved during my visit.

I had a great experience with the GP surgery staff, who were extremely friendly and welcoming. They made me feel at ease from the moment I arrived, and the nurse went above and beyond to explain everything in detail. The doctor was also very patient and took the time to answer all my questions. However, I did find some of the administrative tasks a bit tedious and confusing.

The staff at this surgery were absolutely fantastic - so kind, caring, and professional! From the receptionist who checked me in with a warm smile to the nurse who explained everything in such detail, I felt truly heard and understood throughout my entire visit. The doctor was also very approachable and took time to answer all my questions, making me feel much more at ease than I had expected.

I was really disappointed with my experience at this GP surgery. The staff seemed completely disorganized and uninterested in helping me, which made me feel frustrated and unheard. Despite the receptionist's initial kindness, things quickly fell apart as we struggled to get through even the simplest tasks. Overall, it was a very underwhelming visit that left me feeling dissatisfied.

The GP surgery I visited had an excellent staff who were all extremely friendly and caring. The receptionist made check-in easy, and the nurse was incredibly kind and explained everything in detail. However, when my actual appointment was delayed due to administrative issues beyond their control, it felt like they weren't entirely transparent about what was happening. It would have been helpful if there was more communication from the staff regarding this delay.

The GP surgery I visited had a great receptionist who checked me in promptly, but unfortunately, the rest of the visit did not live up to my expectations. The nurse seemed rushed and uninterested, which made it difficult for me to get clear answers to all my questions. To make matters worse, the doctor barely spoke to me, leaving me feeling unheard and frustrated.

I had a mixed experience with this GP surgery.

"The staff were friendly but not particularly attentive during my appointment with Dr Smith. The GP took some time to examine me, which was understandable given the complexity of my condition. However, I did feel a bit rushed after the consultation.

I recently had a follow-up appointment with the same GP and was pleased to find that they remembered me from our previous meeting and took a more detailed look at my treatment plan. The nurse seemed more interested in my concerns this time around, which made me feel valued as a patient. Overall, I'm satisfied with the level of care I've received.

I had a very poor experience at this surgery last week. I was seen by a nurse who seemed completely overwhelmed and didn't bother to explain what they were doing or why. The GP was also inattentive and didn't ask me any questions about my symptoms. To make matters worse, the receptionist got my appointment time wrong and I had to wait 20 minutes for my appointment.

I've been attending this surgery for years and have always found the staff to be friendly and helpful. However, during my last visit, I felt like I was just a number rather than a patient. The GP seemed to be in a rush and didn't take the time to discuss my treatment options with me. Despite this, the nurse was kind and caring, which made up for the poor service from the doctor.

The surgery has been a disaster from start to finish. First of all, I couldn't find the correct entrance, which led to a 10-minute detour through the car park. When I finally arrived at the reception desk, I was told that my appointment had been cancelled due to "" administrative errors"". The GP eventually saw me, but not before being kept waiting for over an hour.

I've been trying to get in touch with the surgery for weeks now and have been met with complete indifference from everyone. The receptionists never answer their phones or respond to emails, which makes it impossible for me to get any information about my appointment or treatment plan. I'm extremely frustrated with this experience so far.

The GP was kind and understanding during our initial consultation, but unfortunately, that's where the helpfulness ended. Throughout the rest of the visit, I was left feeling abandoned and unsupported. The nurse didn't seem interested in my concerns and barely even looked at me before rushing off to attend to someone else. It felt like I was just a fleeting thought rather than an actual patient.

I recently had a follow-up appointment with this surgery and was disappointed by the lack of continuity of care. My GP seemed completely disconnected from my previous treatment plan and didn't ask any questions about how I'd been feeling or if my symptoms had changed. It felt like they were treating me like a new patient all over again, rather than someone who'd already established a relationship with them.

I've been going to this surgery for years and have always found the staff to be very helpful and caring.

"The GP practice has a very limited number of appointments available, often forcing patients to wait for hours or even days to see their regular doctor. This can be frustrating, especially when one is genuinely unwell and needs urgent attention.

I've been going to this surgery for years, but I've noticed that the appointment availability has gotten worse over time. It's not uncommon to have to book weeks in advance just to get a same-day appointment, which defeats the purpose of having a GP practice in the first place.

The reception staff at my local GP surgery were friendly and helpful when I first started going there, but lately, they've been consistently unhelpful and dismissive. When I called to inquire about availability for an urgent appointment, I was told that none were available for another two weeks - a ridiculous wait time considering I'm already feeling poorly.

I recently had a mixed experience at my GP surgery regarding appointment availability. Initially, the receptionist seemed quite understanding when I explained my situation and offered me some options for alternative appointments. However, later in the process, I found out that these alternatives were not actually available due to high demand. This lack of transparency made me question whether the practice genuinely cares about its patients' needs.

I've been attending this surgery for a while now, but one issue that has started to bother me is the lack of availability when it comes to appointments. The receptionist seemed friendly and efficient at first, but on my last visit, I was told there were no available slots until next week, which would have meant having to take time off work.

Unfortunately, I've had a couple of disappointing experiences with my local GP surgery regarding appointment availability. During my most recent visit, the nurse seemed rushed and distracted, which made me feel like an inconvenience rather than a patient in need. The receptionist didn't do much better, barely acknowledging my concerns before moving on to the next person.

I've always been satisfied with the service provided by my GP surgery, but I did encounter an issue with appointment availability recently. When I called to book an urgent appointment, the receptionist told me that they had limited availability and could only schedule something for a few days later. While this wasn't ideal, I was able to find alternative arrangements through another healthcare provider.

It's been a while since I've visited my GP surgery, but when I did, I found that the practice struggled with appointment availability. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed, and there were long wait times to get an appointment scheduled. This made me wonder whether the practice is truly equipped to handle patient needs.

I recently had a good experience at my local GP surgery, primarily due to their efficient appointment system.

"The facility cleanliness could be improved. Some days it looked very clean, but others were a bit messy.

I recently visited this GP surgery and was impressed by the cleanliness of the waiting area. The staff seemed to take pride in their work and made sure everything was tidy. However, I did notice that the bathrooms could use a good deep clean. Overall, it's a great facility with a few minor tweaks needed for perfection.

The reception area is always spotless when I visit, but sometimes I've seen dirty dishes left behind by patients after meals. The surgery as a whole has a very modern and comfortable atmosphere, which is lovely. However, there have been times when the floor seemed sticky or the trash bins weren't emptied promptly enough. With a bit more attention to detail, it could be a truly exceptional facility.

I was disappointed with the state of the surgery's facilities during my visit. The waiting room was clean but somewhat cramped, and I noticed a few patients leaving their belongings behind. Additionally, the soap dispensers in the bathrooms were empty for most of my visit, which made me wonder if they were being refilled regularly. A bit more attention to these details would improve the overall experience.

I've been to this surgery several times now, and while it's always clean, there have been instances where I saw dirty linens or trash cans not emptied quickly enough. The staff is usually friendly and efficient, but sometimes it feels like they're struggling with the volume of patients. A thorough cleaning schedule would go a long way in maintaining high standards.

The surgery has made significant strides in recent months to improve cleanliness, particularly in the waiting area. I was impressed by the professionalism displayed by the receptionist and nurses. However, there were a few moments when it felt like they could have done better – for example, one of the bathrooms had a dirty towel left behind on the floor.

I visited this GP surgery with some concerns about my health, and while the staff did their best to address them, I couldn't help but notice that the facility's cleanliness was lacking.

The GP surgery is generally excellent, but the appointment availability is often limited. Sometimes it's hard to get a same-day appointment or one that fits around my schedule. However, when I do manage to book an appointment, the staff are always polite and efficient. The doctor takes the time to listen to my concerns and provide helpful advice. The only downside is that they don't seem to offer as many evening appointments as other surgeries.

I was kept waiting for 45 minutes before seeing the doctor.

However, the nurse who attended to me was very kind and explained everything clearly in simple terms.
Despite this, I couldn't shake off the feeling of frustration with the slow service.
I'm not sure if it's a result of understaffing or just an unusually busy day, but I hope they can improve on the waiting times soon.

"The GP surgery was full most of the time when I needed to book an appointment which caused a delay in my treatment. The receptionist apologized for the wait time and offered me a later date which I appreciated.

I found it really hard to get an appointment with this surgery due to their limited availability, it made me feel like I wasn't a priority patient. They often have a long waiting list and can be quite slow to respond to queries. Despite all this, the staff were friendly and helpful when I finally did attend an appointment.

I was able to book an appointment online but it took ages to get confirmation and the surgery didn't provide any reminders or updates about my appointment.

"The staff were friendly and helpful during my visit. However, the waiting room was quite crowded and noisy. The nurse seemed a bit flustered, but still took the time to answer all my questions thoroughly. I appreciated their professionalism, even if the atmosphere wasn't ideal. Overall, it was a decent experience, and I would recommend this surgery.

The reception staff were polite but not particularly enthusiastic, which made me feel like just another number in a long queue. The nurse was friendly and competent, but seemed to be dealing with multiple patients at once, which added to the sense of chaos. Despite this, they managed to answer all my questions and provided good aftercare instructions. However, I did find the appointment system to be somewhat opaque, and wasn't sure what time I'd actually be seen. It took a while for them to sort out my schedule, but eventually we got there.

I recently had an excellent experience at this GP surgery, which is quite rare in today's medical landscape. From the moment I arrived, I was treated with kindness and professionalism by both the receptionist and the nurse. They were very patient and explained everything in detail, which put me at ease. The doctor took time to answer all my questions thoroughly, and even provided some additional guidance on managing a chronic condition. Overall, it was a wonderful experience that left me feeling heard and understood.

The staff were generally unfriendly and unprofessional during my visit, which made the whole process feel unpleasant. The receptionist barely acknowledged me when I arrived, and the nurse seemed put out by having to see another patient. The doctor arrived late, which added to the sense of disorganization. While they did manage to sort out my issues, it felt like a chore rather than a positive interaction.

I had mixed feelings about my experience at this GP surgery. On the one hand, the reception staff were very efficient and made check-in easy. However, I found the nurse to be somewhat dismissive of my concerns, which left me feeling unheard. The doctor was friendly but didn't take as much time to answer all my questions as I would have liked. Overall, it was a decent experience, but not outstanding in any way.

The entire experience at this GP surgery felt like a disaster from start to finish. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and unfriendly, which set the tone for the rest of the visit.

"The reception staff were friendly and welcoming making my appointment booking process easy. The GP was efficient and took time to explain my condition. I was pleased with the overall service provided.

I found the wait times to be excessive and the receptionist seemed disorganized, which led to delays in seeing the doctor. Despite this, the GP was competent and provided good care. However, the clinic's lack of appointment availability made it difficult for me to get an appointment quickly enough.

I recently visited this surgery for the first time and had a thoroughly disappointing experience. The waiting room was dirty and the staff seemed put off by my presence. When I finally met with the GP, they were rushed and dismissive, failing to address all of my concerns. Overall, I would not recommend this surgery due to its poor management of appointment availability.

The online booking system is user-friendly, but the clinic's availability is inconsistent, sometimes leaving me waiting for hours. The staff are friendly and apologetic when things go wrong, which is appreciated. However, I wish they could improve their scheduling process to accommodate more patients.

I have been a patient at this surgery for several years and have always found the staff to be kind and helpful. They make an effort to ensure that you feel comfortable during your appointment, whether it's providing blankets or offering a seat in a quiet room. The GP is also excellent and takes the time to explain your condition and treatment options.

Unfortunately, I had a terrible experience at this surgery due to its poor management of appointment availability. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and uninterested in helping me find an available time slot. Despite this, the GP was competent and provided good care. However, the clinic's lack of planning and organization made it difficult for me to receive timely medical attention.

I recently moved to a new area and needed to find a GP surgery, so I chose this one based on online reviews. Unfortunately, my experience has been largely negative due to its poor appointment availability. The waiting room is uncomfortable, and the staff seem disorganized, which adds to the frustration of waiting for an extended period. Despite this, the GP was kind and made an effort to explain my condition.

They made my visit stress-free with a warm smile and efficient service.

I had a good experience with the GP surgery, mainly due to the reception staff's professionalism. They were knowledgeable about the procedures and answered all my questions thoroughly. The receptionist was particularly impressive as she was patient and courteous. 

However, I did find some of the staff to be unfriendly and unhelpful during my recent visit. Despite my concerns, they seemed more focused on completing their tasks quickly rather than addressing them properly. This left me feeling frustrated and unheard.

I recently visited this surgery for a routine check-up, and I was pleased with how efficiently it went. The receptionist checked me in promptly, and the nurse provided all the necessary care. The only area for improvement would be to have more staff present during peak hours.

The GP surgery's reception staff left much to be desired on my last visit. They seemed completely disinterested in my problems and gave off an air of apathy, which was discouraging. When I tried to follow up on certain issues, they appeared unhelpful and dismissive, making the entire experience quite underwhelming.

I had mixed feelings about my recent surgery appointment. On one hand, the reception staff were courteous and helpful; however, they seemed a bit distracted throughout the visit. The nurse was attentive, but the doctor appeared rushed.

"The GP surgery was surprisingly busy on a Tuesday afternoon with no availability for same day appointments after 2 pm.

I found the staff quite dismissive and uninterested in my concerns. The receptionist barely acknowledged me, and the nurse seemed rushed. They managed to fit me in at short notice but I couldn't shake off the feeling that they were more focused on their workload than genuinely helping me.

The GP surgery was a godsend, thanks to its excellent appointment availability. As someone with a busy work schedule, it's a lifesaver to be able to book appointments quickly and easily online or over the phone. The staff are always friendly and accommodating, and I've never had to wait long for an appointment. On top of that, they offer extended hours on Fridays which is perfect for those of us who need to catch up with our doctor.

I was forced to visit this GP surgery due to a medical emergency. Unfortunately, the entire experience was marred by a complete lack of availability for same day appointments. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and the nurse appeared stressed. I was left waiting for over an hour before seeing the doctor, which was frustrating given my urgent condition.

I had high expectations from this GP surgery but unfortunately they fell short on one crucial aspect - appointment availability. Despite their long waiting times and limited opening hours, I still manage to find them quite friendly and efficient once inside. The only reason I'm not giving them a higher rating is that I sometimes find it difficult to book appointments in advance.

The GP surgery has excellent appointment availability despite being in a busy area of the city. However, there was one occasion where I had to wait for over 30 minutes for my appointment, which felt frustrating given their online booking system is supposed to streamline this process. The staff seemed friendly and competent but this one lapse did leave me feeling slightly disappointed.

I've been going to this GP surgery for years and have always found their appointment availability to be excellent. They seem to have a good balance of busy days and quiet periods which means I rarely find myself waiting long for an appointment. The only time I was forced to wait was when the practice was closed due to bad weather, but that wasn't really outside of their control.

I recently had a great experience with this GP surgery, largely thanks to its availability of same day appointments. As someone who often forgets to book appointments in advance, it's been a lifesaver to be able to just turn up whenever I need to see the doctor. The staff were friendly and efficient, making me feel at ease.

This GP surgery fell short in terms of appointment availability, which was a major letdown. On two separate occasions, I had to wait over an hour for my appointments, which made me question the practice's online booking system. However, on both other visits, I found the staff to be extremely friendly and knowledgeable, making up for the lack of availability.

The GP surgery offered excellent appointment availability and a welcoming atmosphere. The receptionist greeted me warmly and explained everything in detail, making my visit feel stress-free. The only reason I wouldn't give them a perfect score is that they don't have a system in place to offer alternative appointment times when you do get an opening that doesn't suit your schedule.

I was disappointed by the lack of availability for same day appointments at this GP surgery. Despite being able to book online, I found myself waiting for over 45 minutes before seeing the doctor, which was frustrating given my urgent condition. The staff seemed friendly but apologetic and rushed in their responses, making me feel like they were struggling to cope with demand.

The GP surgery has excellent appointment availability and is generally a great experience. However, there have been times when I've had to wait for an extended period before seeing the doctor, which can be frustrating if you're already feeling anxious or stressed about your condition.

"The staff were friendly but the waiting time was long.
I had to wait for over an hour before being seen by a doctor, which was frustrating especially since I was running late due to traffic. The receptionist did offer me a cup of tea, though, so that was nice.

The GP surgery is very welcoming and accommodating. From booking an appointment online through the initial consultation, everything went smoothly and without any issues. However, upon further examination by the nurse, some concerns were raised about my diagnosis which ultimately led to a more thorough investigation. The staff were excellent throughout the whole process but did seem a bit rushed at times.

I was impressed with how well-organized the surgery was, from check-in to discharge. The receptionist checked me in promptly and efficiently, while the nurse explained everything clearly and thoroughly. However, I felt that my concerns about my test results weren't fully addressed until much later when the doctor came back to discuss them with me.

Unfortunately, my experience at this GP surgery was marred by a series of small mistakes. The receptionist forgot to schedule my appointment for an earlier time, which caused unnecessary delays, and the nurse seemed disorganized and inattentive during our consultation.

I had mixed feelings about my visit to this GP surgery - while some aspects were excellent, others fell short.

I've had mixed experiences at this surgery - sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad. On one hand, the staff are generally friendly and welcoming. The receptionist makes check-in easy, and the nurse is kind and willing to help. However, when I have a medical concern that requires some attention, things can quickly fall apart.

The GP surgery staff are generally friendly and welcoming, but there's a problem with communication.

It's clear that they're understaffed and overworked, which can make it difficult to get any real support or care.

I recently had a great experience at this GP surgery from the moment I walked in, the receptionist greeted me warmly and made check-in easy. The doctor took time to explain my diagnosis and treatment options, which was really appreciated. However, the waiting room could be improved with more seating and quieter background music.

The GP surgery staff were unhelpful and unprofessional, making the visit frustrating as I had been waiting for over an hour with no updates on why we were still waiting. The receptionist barely acknowledged me, and the nurse seemed rushed. 

I have to say that this GP surgery exceeded my expectations from start to finish, from the friendly receptionist to the caring doctor who explained everything in detail. They even offered some useful advice on managing stress. My only suggestion would be to improve the waiting area with more comfortable seating and better air quality.

The GP surgery experience was a mixed bag - while the staff were very friendly, the receptionist seemed overwhelmed which made the process feel slow.

"The reception staff were very friendly and helpful making my visit stress free and efficient.

I had a terrible experience with the GP surgery's appointment availability. They cancelled my appointment without notice and refused to reschedule it for weeks, forcing me to book another appointment at a different time. The staff seemed completely uninterested in resolving the issue, just apologetic but unhelpful. I was really disappointed as this is not the first time they have let me down with appointments.

I recently had an excellent experience at this GP surgery's reception desk. They were extremely efficient and managed to fit me in on short notice for a same-day appointment. The staff were friendly and welcoming, making me feel comfortable throughout the visit. I was also impressed by how well-organized the waiting area was, with everything neatly labeled and tidy. Overall, I was very pleased with my experience.

The GP surgery's online booking system is broken again, wasting my time and effort in trying to book an appointment that never materialized. The receptionist seemed clueless and uninterested when I complained about the issue, just sending me a generic apology email without any actual help or resolution. This is not the first time this has happened, and it's getting really frustrating.

I was pleasantly surprised by how professional and caring the staff were at this GP surgery. They made check-in easy and answered all my questions thoroughly. The receptionist was especially friendly and welcoming, putting me at ease throughout the visit. However, I did find that some of the waiting area amenities were a bit outdated and in need of an upgrade.

The entire experience felt rushed and impersonal at this GP surgery. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and stressed, and the nurse barely had time to examine me before rushing off to see the next patient. The doctor was also curt with their diagnosis and treatment plan, without taking the time to explain anything thoroughly. Overall, I felt like a number rather than a patient.

I've been going to this GP surgery for years, but their appointment availability has really started to deteriorate in recent months.

I had a great experience with the GP surgery's vaccination team! They were super friendly and made me feel at ease from the start. The nurse answered all my questions thoroughly and explained everything in detail. I even got a few extra vaccinations done to catch up on some missed appointments.

The GP surgery's vaccination service is top-notch, but they could improve on communication. I called in for a vaccination appointment and was told it would take 15 minutes, but the waiting time ended up being more like an hour. The nurse was very nice and explained everything clearly, though, so that made the wait somewhat bearable.

I recently visited this GP surgery for my annual flu vaccination, and unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. The receptionist seemed put off by my presence from the start, and the nurse didn't explain things as well as she could have.

"Staff were friendly and helpful during my visit but the follow-up appointment was cancelled due to the practice being closed on weekends. I had to call again to reschedule, which caused a delay in receiving my treatment. The receptionist apologized for the inconvenience, but it would have been better if they could have offered alternative dates earlier.

I recently switched from another GP surgery and was impressed with how smoothly I've been treated by this practice. The nurse explained everything clearly during my appointment, and the doctor provided personalized recommendations for my condition. However, the follow-up care has been less than ideal - I received a letter with some conflicting information that made me question their expertise.

The practice staff were courteous but the follow-up process was slow. My test results took weeks to receive, and when they did, it turned out there was an error. The receptionist seemed apologetic but ultimately unable to provide any resolution or compensation for the delay.

I had a positive experience with this GP surgery, from check-in to appointment completion. However, the follow-up care has been lacking in terms of communication. I've received incomplete and inaccurate information about my treatment plan, which has caused me unnecessary stress.

It's been two months since my initial consultation with Dr. Smith, but I still haven't received a follow-up appointment. The practice seems to be understaffed, resulting in delayed appointments and missed checks-in. The staff member on the phone said they would send a reminder letter, but it hasn't arrived yet.

I recently had a concerning diagnosis made by this GP surgery, and while the initial consultation was thorough, I'm not satisfied with the follow-up care. The doctor's advice seems overly restrictive, and I've been left feeling anxious about my future treatment options.

The staff at this surgery were professional but unenthusiastic during my visit. However, after scheduling a follow-up appointment, I received an automated letter informing me that it had been cancelled due to ""staffing issues."" This lack of communication caused frustration and wasted time.

I have mixed feelings about the GP surgery experience so far. While the initial consultation was well-received, with friendly and knowledgeable staff, the follow-up care has fallen short. The practice seems disorganized, resulting in missed appointments and forgotten test results.

The GP surgery receptionist was pleasant and efficient but failed to provide timely updates on my appointment schedule. Despite multiple phone calls and emails, I still haven't received any information about when I can reschedule a follow-up appointment.

I recently underwent treatment for a chronic condition with this GP surgery, which has been generally satisfactory in terms of care. However, the follow-up process could be improved.

"The reception staff were friendly but disorganized, causing a significant delay in my appointment.

I had a generally positive experience with the GP surgery's reception staff, they were efficient and courteous. However, I did find them to be somewhat dismissive when I asked about the cost of medication, which made me feel like I was being taken advantage of. The nurse who saw me afterwards was lovely, but it felt like the reception staff had set the tone for a more impersonal experience.

I recently visited this GP surgery and was thoroughly impressed with the professionalism and kindness shown by the reception staff. They were warm and welcoming, making me feel at ease from the moment I arrived. The nurse who attended to me afterwards was also incredibly friendly and explained everything in detail. It's clear that they value their patients' time and well-being.

I have mixed feelings about my experience with this GP surgery's reception staff. On the one hand, they were always cheerful and made sure I had a cup of tea while I waited. However, when it came to actually checking me in, the process was slow and painful, with multiple errors on their part. It would be great if they could streamline their system to make things run more smoothly.

The GP surgery's reception staff left a lot to be desired during my last visit. The woman behind the desk seemed completely uninterested in helping me, barely even looking up from her phone as I waited for what felt like an eternity.

Unfortunately, my experience with this GP surgery's reception staff was marred by their complete lack of communication.

The results were mostly negative and confirmed what we suspected: I had a serious underlying condition that needed urgent treatment. The staff were efficient but unemotional, which was somewhat unsettling.

We finally got some clarity on our test results after weeks of uncertainty. Thankfully, everything checked out okay, thanks to the diligent work of the lab technicians.",positive,0.7240654230117798,122.0,3,Test Results,gratitude,1,0.7240654230117798,Test Results

"The GP practice staff were very friendly and welcoming however availability of appointments was a real issue, leaving us waiting for over an hour before being seen. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed with the number of patients, but the nurse did her best to keep us informed about wait times. 

I had mixed feelings about my visit to this surgery, the staff were generally nice but the system is so inefficient that I waited in the waiting room for two hours before being called back. The receptionist kept saying that the doctor was running behind and it seemed like they didn't have enough staff. Eventually we got seen by the doctor who was very kind and explained everything clearly. 

I recently visited this GP surgery for a check up and overall had a positive experience, the staff were friendly and helpful however I did find the appointment availability to be quite difficult to secure, even booking in advance. The receptionist made an effort to explain the wait times but it still felt frustrating at times. The doctor was great though and took the time to discuss my health with me.

I recently had a poor experience at this GP surgery due to issues with appointment availability. I booked an appointment for 2 pm but arrived early, only to be told that there was a delay of over an hour because they were short-staffed. The receptionist seemed completely disorganized and unhelpful, it made me question the care that I would receive. 

I recently attended this surgery for a minor issue and overall had a good experience, the staff were friendly and efficient however I did find the appointment system to be a bit confusing. It took us 45 minutes to get seen but once we saw the doctor everything was sorted. The receptionist explained what was going on with our wait times which made things easier for me.

I recently visited this GP surgery after being referred by my dentist, unfortunately the experience was underwhelming due in part to issues with appointment availability. I had to wait over an hour before seeing the doctor and felt like I was just another number rather than a patient. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed but the nurse did try to keep me informed about wait times.

This GP surgery had some good qualities however one major issue is the poor system for booking appointments which left us waiting in the waiting room for over two hours before being seen by the doctor.

"I've been going to this GP surgery for a few years now and overall I'm very happy with the service they provide. The staff are friendly and efficient, always knowing exactly who you are when you walk in. However, my recent visit was a bit of an exception to this rule - the receptionist seemed put off by my appointment time and barely acknowledged me before sending me straight back to wait. But on the day I saw the actual doctor and nurse, they were both fantastic, really taking the time to explain everything and answer all my questions. Still, it's just a shame that not everyone has the same level of customer service.",positive,0.9392919540405272,114.0,4,Reception Staff Interaction,disappointment,1,0.9392919540405272,Follow-up and Continuity of Care

"The GP practice staff were overly cautious with my diagnosis, repeatedly questioning my symptoms even though I'd explained them clearly. However, the treatment itself was effective and prompt, with minimal side effects. Overall, a decent experience despite some unnecessary delays.

I found the staff quite dismissive and uninterested in my concerns. The receptionist barely acknowledged me, and the nurse seemed rushed as she worked through her list of patients. Despite this, the actual diagnosis and treatment were thorough and well-explained by the doctor. I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything that was discussed.

The GP practice is run with a high level of professionalism and care. The staff are friendly and welcoming, always willing to answer any questions or provide reassurance when needed. However, some waiting times can be quite long due to the high demand on their services. This did not detract from my overall positive experience.

I was pleasantly surprised by how professional and caring the staff were. They made check-in easy and answered all my questions thoroughly. The GP itself was thorough in diagnosing and treating my condition, although I do wish they'd explained some of the medication side effects better. Overall a great experience despite some minor annoyances.

The doctor was excellent, but the entire practice felt rather impersonal. The receptionist seemed more focused on processing paperwork than attending to patient needs, and the waiting area could have used some refreshing updates. Still, the quality of care I received made up for it in the end.

I've been going to this GP surgery for years, and while some aspects are still improving, the staff have shown immense dedication to their patients' well-being. The treatment I received was spot on, but what really stood out was how the receptionist took extra time to explain everything about my diagnosis and options available to me.",neutral,0.4326482713222503,308.0,4,Staff Professionalism,admiration,1,0.4326482713222503,Treatment Quality

"The GP surgery's appointment availability could be improved. The online booking system often fails, leaving me waiting for hours at the practice. They do, however, have a good selection of early morning appointments available.

I was disappointed with my recent visit to this GP surgery - the receptionist seemed completely uninterested in my concerns and kept interrupting me mid-sentence. I had been waiting over an hour before being seen, which didn't help the situation at all.

The GP practice has limited appointment availability, especially for evenings and weekends. However, they do make it easy to book appointments online and provide a clear explanation of any out-of-hours procedures in place.

I recently attended this surgery with my elderly mother and was pleased that we were able to secure an early morning appointment well in advance. The receptionist was friendly and the nurse provided excellent care.

Unfortunately, my recent experience at this GP surgery was marred by poor communication from the receptionist - she seemed completely overwhelmed and unprepared for the number of patients waiting in.

"The staff were very accommodating and understanding.

I had trouble finding an appointment on short notice and was relieved when they managed to squeeze me in despite their busy schedule. The waiting area was comfortable, and the receptionist offered me a cup of tea while I waited. Overall, my experience was excellent, and I would highly recommend this surgery to anyone in need of medical attention.

I had mixed feelings about the appointment availability at this GP surgery. While it's great that they have flexible hours, I found it difficult to book an appointment on short notice due to their limited slots. The receptionist was friendly, but it took a while to get seen. Despite the occasional wait, I've been seen promptly and treated well when I have attended.

I had a terrible experience with this GP surgery's appointment availability. I called them multiple times to try and book an appointment, but they never seemed to have any available despite advertising their flexibility online. The waiting area was cramped and uncomfortable, and the staff seemed overwhelmed by the demand for appointments. Overall, my visit was frustrating, and I won't be using them again.

This GP surgery has a great reputation in our area, which is why I chose to use them. Unfortunately, their appointment availability fell short of expectations. While they do have extended hours, it's difficult to get an appointment on short notice due to the limited slots. The receptionist was kind and apologetic when I asked about availability, but ultimately, I had to settle for a less-than-ideal appointment time.

The staff at this GP surgery were generally friendly and helpful, but their appointment availability was inconsistent. Sometimes they seemed to have plenty of space, while other times it felt like every slot was taken. The waiting area was clean and comfortable, but the overall experience was let down by the variable availability of appointments.

I had a disappointing experience with this GP surgery's appointment system. Despite calling multiple times, I couldn't get an appointment on short notice due to the limited slots available. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed, and I felt like I was competing with others for a spot. Overall, my visit was rushed and not as smooth as I would have liked.

The GP surgery's online booking system is user-friendly, but their actual availability of appointments can be limited. Sometimes it feels like they're overscheduling themselves, leading to long waits. The staff are generally kind and helpful, though, and the waiting area is comfortable.

I was pleasantly surprised by this GP surgery's appointment availability. Despite having a busy schedule, the receptionist managed to book me in quickly. However, I did have to wait for about 20 minutes before seeing my doctor. Overall, my experience was positive, but the waiting time could be shorter.

The staff at this GP surgery were polite and efficient, making my visit smooth and stress-free. The appointment system was also convenient, with multiple options available online.

"The staff were friendly but kept me waiting for over an hour.

I was initially frustrated with the long wait time, but after speaking with the receptionist, she explained that it was due to a prior emergency room visit and assured me that my appointment would be seen as soon as possible. Although I waited for over an hour, the staff made up for it by being genuinely apologetic and helpful. The doctor arrived promptly and attended to my concerns thoroughly. Overall, while waiting time could have been improved, the care provided was excellent.

The wait times are often lengthy, but the medical staff seems to be doing their best with a limited number of appointments per day. However, some patients might find it hard to stay patient, especially if they're not well or in discomfort. The good news is that the doctors and nurses do make an effort to communicate effectively with you during your visit.

I had a mixed experience with my recent visit. While the waiting time was almost two hours long, I was impressed by how well-organized the office seemed to be despite this delay. The receptionist kept me informed about the status of each doctor and nurse, which made me feel more at ease. Despite the wait, I felt that my concerns were adequately addressed by the medical team. Perhaps just one thing would have made my visit even better: a bit more prompt attention from some staff members.

I've been going to this surgery for years and have generally had good experiences with their services. However, during my last visit, I encountered some issues with waiting times that left me feeling frustrated. Despite being kept informed about the status of my appointment, it took over an hour before I was seen by the doctor. The staff seemed apologetic but not overly concerned about resolving the issue quickly.

I visited this surgery after hearing mixed reviews from friends and family members. Unfortunately, my own experience didn't help to change their opinions too much. My wait time was around 45 minutes, which is understandable considering the office had fewer patients than usual. Despite this, some of the staff seemed somewhat detached and distant from me, which made it harder for me to establish a rapport with them.

The waiting room was modern and clean when I arrived, but it took about an hour before I was called back for my appointment. While I understand that delays can happen due to various reasons, the fact remains that waiting time is a significant concern for many patients, including myself. Perhaps if some staff members were more proactive in addressing these issues, they could minimize this issue's impact on patient satisfaction.

I recently had an extremely positive experience at this surgery, and one of the main reasons was the reasonable wait time. My appointment started promptly without any significant delays, which made me feel much more comfortable than I would have otherwise. The staff seemed genuinely concerned with providing excellent care to each and every patient, and it showed in their attentiveness throughout my visit.

The waiting room at this surgery can get quite crowded on busy days, but the receptionist did a great job of keeping everyone informed about wait times and the progress of appointments. Although I had been waiting for 20 minutes before being seen by the doctor, I appreciated the staff's professionalism and courtesy during my appointment. Overall, it was a pleasant visit that left me feeling satisfied with the service provided.

I found the waiting time at this surgery to be unusually long - over two hours! While I understand that delays can occur due to unforeseen circumstances, I couldn't help but feel frustrated by the prolonged wait. Despite this, the medical team seemed genuinely committed to providing excellent care to each patient, and their attentiveness during my visit made up for the inconvenience of waiting time.

I've been a long-time client of this surgery, but during my most recent visit, I was dismayed by the lengthy wait times. Despite being informed about the status of my appointment several times, it took over an hour before I was seen by the doctor. While I appreciate the efforts made by some staff members to make up for lost time, I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed by this experience.

I had mixed feelings during my visit to this surgery. On one hand, the waiting room was modern and well-maintained, which set a positive tone for my visit. However, after being kept waiting for over an hour, I started to feel frustrated and anxious about having to wait even longer. Although some staff members were apologetic and attentive during my appointment, I couldn't help but feel that the long wait time overshadowed their good intentions.

The surgery seemed well-organized overall, with the receptionist doing a great job of keeping everyone informed about wait times. While it took me about an hour to be seen by the doctor, I appreciated their professionalism and courtesy during my appointment. Perhaps just one thing would have made this visit even better: a bit more proactive communication from some staff members regarding delays.

I was pleasantly surprised by how efficient and professional the surgery seemed despite the wait time, which was quite long - over 45 minutes! While waiting in the lobby, I was informed about the status of my appointment multiple times, which helped alleviate any anxiety or frustration. Although it took a bit longer than anticipated to be seen by the doctor, their attentiveness during my visit made up for this delay.

The staff at this surgery were friendly and courteous despite having a busy day with numerous appointments scheduled. However, the prolonged wait time of over two hours left me feeling frustrated. Perhaps if they could better manage their schedule or communicate more effectively about delays, they could reduce the waiting time without compromising the quality of care provided.

Overall, I had mixed feelings during my visit to this surgery. While some staff members were attentive and caring, others seemed somewhat disconnected from patients. The wait time was also a significant concern for me - it took around 45 minutes before being seen by the doctor. Perhaps if they could improve their communication about delays, they could make this experience even better for all patients.

Despite having been told that the surgery had a busy schedule, I found my wait time to be significantly longer than expected. It took over an hour and a half before I was finally called back for my appointment, which left me feeling anxious and frustrated. While some staff members were apologetic and attentive during my visit, the prolonged wait time overshadowed their good intentions.

I recently had an experience that left me feeling both relieved and disappointed - not because of the surgery itself but due to the lengthy wait time. After being kept waiting for over two hours, I was still able to receive excellent care from the doctor and the nursing staff. Perhaps if the scheduling could be better managed or communication about delays improved, patients wouldn't have to endure such extended waits.

I had mixed feelings about my recent visit. The receptionist was efficient but seemed put off by my questions, while the nurse was kind but didn't explain everything thoroughly. The doctor was competent but didn't take much time to discuss my treatment options. Overall, it was an average visit.

Our GP is consistently excellent, thanks to their staff who are not only professional but also genuinely care about patients' well-being. From check-in to diagnosis and treatment, they make the process as smooth and stress-free as possible. I've had several appointments now and have never been disappointed.

The staff at this surgery left a sour taste in my mouth.

I had to ask multiple times for them. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed on the day of my appointment, which was slightly concerning. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, but I do wish they could have gotten it right first time.

I was impressed by how quickly I received my test results from the GP surgery - just 24 hours after my appointment. This is significantly faster than what other surgeries in the area are offering. The staff were also very helpful and explained everything to me in detail.

Still, overall I'm really happy with the service I received.

I recently had a very disappointing experience at this GP surgery due to issues with receiving my test results. Despite requesting them via email several days before my appointment, they still hadn't been sent out by the time I arrived.

I found the GP surgery to be very efficient in providing test results - I had them within hours of my appointment, which was greatly appreciated. However, there were some issues with getting in touch with the practice initially - I had to send multiple emails before anyone responded. Once everything was sorted out, though, the staff were friendly and helpful.

I'm really happy with how quickly I received my test results from this GP surgery - it's a significant improvement over what other surgeries are offering.

The test results from this GP surgery were a bit confusing - it would have been helpful if someone could have explained them to me more clearly before I left.

"The vaccination process was efficient and well-organized. However, the nurse seemed rushed during the administration of my shot, which made me feel a bit uncomfortable.

Overall, it was a good experience, but room for improvement in terms of patient care.

The vaccinations were given promptly and correctly by our nurse, who explained the process thoroughly before administering each shot. However, when I expressed concern about my vaccination schedule to the receptionist, she seemed dismissive and unhelpful. The waiting area was also quite crowded during our visit. Despite this, the doctor's explanation of the vaccine's benefits was clear and reassuring. 

I recently visited this GP surgery for a flu vaccination and was extremely disappointed with the experience. The nurse gave me the vaccine too quickly without explaining its purpose or potential side effects, leaving me feeling unprepared. When I asked to speak to the receptionist, they seemed put off and told me they were busy. I had to repeat my question three times before getting any assistance.

I recently visited this GP surgery for a MMR vaccination and was pleasantly surprised by how professional and caring the staff were.

"The GP practice is a mixed bag. On one hand, the staff are friendly but somewhat disorganized, leading to lengthy wait times. The doctor seemed overwhelmed with paperwork during my appointment, which made it difficult for me to get my questions answered. However, the nurse was kind and efficient in her care, which helped mitigate some of the frustration. Overall, I'm not sure if this practice is right for everyone.

I had a decent experience at this GP surgery but felt let down by the follow-up care. After my initial appointment, I didn't receive any post-visit updates or advice on managing my condition, despite my requests for more information. This lack of continuity of care made me feel like I was being neglected.

The GP practice has improved significantly since I first started attending. The reception staff are now much friendlier and more organized, which reduces wait times greatly. However, the doctor is still a bit short-tempered during consultations, which can be off-putting at times. Still, it's clear that they're working to improve.

My experience with this GP surgery has been inconsistent. Some of the staff are genuinely kind and caring, but others seem disconnected from their patients' needs. I had to repeat myself multiple times to get my appointment scheduled, which was frustrating. On the other hand, the nurse who saw me during the visit was extremely attentive and knowledgeable.

The GP practice's follow-up care is severely lacking. After my appointment, I didn't receive any updates or advice on managing my condition, despite my requests for more information. This lack of continuity of care makes it difficult for me to manage my health effectively. I've had to seek care elsewhere for support.

I was pleasantly surprised by the GP surgery's efficiency during my visit. The reception staff were friendly and organized, which reduced wait times greatly. However, the doctor seemed dismissive during our conversation, which made me feel like my concerns weren't being taken seriously. Still, it's clear that they're working to improve their communication skills.

This GP practice has been a disappointment overall. Despite my repeated requests for more information on my condition, I never received any updates or advice on managing it. The staff seemed disinterested in my care, and the doctor barely spoke with me during our consultation.

"The reception staff were unfriendly and slow, making my visit feel rushed and stressful.

I had a mixed experience with the reception staff at this surgery. The woman who checked me in was very friendly and made sure I had all the necessary forms to fill out. However, when I asked for an appointment, she seemed put off and didn't explain what time slot was available. When my actual appointment came around, I was kept waiting for over 20 minutes before being seen by the doctor.

I recently moved into the area and needed to register with a new GP surgery. The reception staff at this practice were extremely welcoming and helpful, making me feel comfortable from the very beginning. They answered all my questions and explained everything in detail, which put me at ease about the registration process. I was also impressed by how organized they seemed, always keeping me informed about any delays or updates.

I had a bit of a bad experience with the reception staff at this surgery. They were extremely busy and didn't seem to have enough staff on duty. When I tried to register, it took them several minutes to finally see me, which was frustrating. Once they did, however, they were friendly and efficient, but the delay put a damper on my visit overall.

The reception staff at this surgery were very apologetic when I had an issue with my appointment. They immediately offered to reschedule or provide a refund, whichever I preferred.

"The receptionist barely acknowledged me, and the wait was an hour long. I had to ask three times for a nurse to see the doctor because they were all on call. The actual consultation was short and lacking in detail. 

I recently visited this surgery and was impressed by how well-organized it was. From check-in to discharge, everything ran smoothly and efficiently. The staff were friendly and courteous, and I felt at ease throughout my visit. However, the appointment availability could be improved, as I had to wait over 30 minutes for my initial consultation. Nevertheless, overall, I was very satisfied with the service I received.

I found the GP's nurse to be extremely kind and attentive during my appointment. The doctor was also very thorough in explaining my diagnosis and treatment options. However, when it came to booking future appointments, the receptionist seemed rather uncooperative, making it difficult for me to secure a convenient time slot. Despite this minor issue, I highly recommend this surgery due to their exceptional care and professionalism.

The practice staff were very welcoming and friendly, but there was an issue with appointment availability that left me frustrated. The doctor I saw was excellent, but the receptionist said they would call when a spot opened up in two weeks, which felt like an eternity for someone who needed urgent attention. It's disappointing that a more timely solution couldn't be offered.

I had a great experience at this surgery, from the initial check-in to the consultation itself. The nurse was very caring and explained everything clearly. However, when I asked about booking future appointments, I was told that availability was limited due to high demand, which is not ideal for someone who needs regular check-ups.

Unfortunately, my visit to this GP surgery was marred by an unacceptably long wait time. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed, and it took over 45 minutes just to be seen by the nurse. When I asked about booking a follow-up appointment, I was told that it would have to be scheduled several weeks in advance. This level of disorganization is unacceptable.

The staff at this surgery were professional and efficient, making my visit as smooth as possible. However, when I called to book an appointment, they only offered one option – two weeks from now – which didn't fit into my schedule. It would have been great if there were more flexible options available.

I was impressed by the GP's bedside manner during my consultation but felt let down by the lack of availability for future appointments. The receptionist mentioned that they often had to turn away patients who wanted same-day appointments due to scheduling constraints, which seemed unreasonable considering the demand in the area.",negative,0.772748589515686,453.0,2,Appointment Availability,disappointment,1,-0.772748589515686,Appointment Availability

"The staff were friendly but overbooked, causing a delay.

I found the GP's approach to my long-term condition to be unorthodox, which may or may not have been effective. The nurse seemed uncertain about their role in managing my treatment plan. On the other hand, I appreciate how quickly they can refer you to specialists when needed. However, this has led to inconsistent follow-up care from different providers.

The GP's assistant was very helpful and made sure all questions were answered. Unfortunately, the receptionist got my name wrong, twice. This minor mistake made me feel like a number rather than a person. The overall experience was pleasant, but the errors in communication detracted from it slightly. I've decided to give them another chance, hoping for better organization.

The GP was knowledgeable and took the time to explain everything, which is more than I can say for most doctors I've seen. However, their office manager seemed extremely stressed and disorganized, making me question whether they were truly prioritizing patient care.

"The GP practice's medication management system is somewhat disorganized, leading to frequent errors with my prescriptions. The staff seemed overwhelmed, but the nurse who explained the issue was kind and apologetic. However, subsequent visits have shown little improvement, with misplaced labels and incorrect refills. I've had to repeatedly call to clarify these issues, wasting valuable time. Despite this, the receptionist always greets me warmly, which is a pleasant contrast to my frustrating experience.

They took the time to answer all my questions and explained everything in detail.

The GP surgery's medication management process is a bit of a nightmare, but the staff do try their best. Unfortunately, this often leads to mistakes with prescriptions and refills. I've lost count of how many times I've called to clarify issues or request corrections. Despite the chaos, the nurse who manages my conditions is kind and willing to listen, which helps alleviate some of the frustration.

I had a generally positive experience at my local GP surgery, but there were a few issues with medication management that left me feeling disappointed. The prescription label was incorrect, and I received the wrong medication for several days before it was corrected. However, the doctor and nurse who handled my case were apologetic and explained what went wrong. They also offered to re-explain everything to ensure I understood my treatment plan.

I recently switched GP surgeries due to issues with their medication management system. Unfortunately, the new practice has not improved in this regard. My prescriptions have been misplaced or filled incorrectly multiple times, leading to unnecessary stress and time wasted on calls to rectify the problems. The staff seem overwhelmed and disorganized, which doesn't help alleviate my concerns.

The GP surgery's medication management team is one of the most efficient I've encountered, ensuring that prescriptions are filled accurately and refills are processed correctly.

The reception staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming! They made check-in easy and efficient, and gave me a warm smile when I arrived. When the nurse came to see me, she was also fantastic - kind, caring, and explained everything clearly. The doctor who came to see me was knowledgeable and took the time to answer all my questions.

"The GP surgery was surprisingly convenient with extended opening hours. However, the waiting room was quite small and uncomfortable. The receptionist seemed rushed and didn't provide much information about my appointment.

I found it difficult to find a suitable time for a consultation when they were fully booked, but once I finally saw the doctor, the experience was good. The GP took the time to explain my treatment options clearly and answered all my questions thoroughly. However, the waiting area could have been improved with more seating and better ventilation.

I was impressed by the GP surgery's accessibility features, such as wheelchair ramps and audio induction loops. Unfortunately, the Wi-Fi connection in the waiting room was slow and unreliable. The receptionist was friendly and helpful, but it took a while to check-in.

The GP surgery's online booking system is user-friendly, but it sometimes doesn't accurately reflect wait times. On the other hand, the appointment I had was well-managed, with a clear schedule and minimal delays. Overall, my experience at this surgery was satisfactory, but there is room for improvement in terms of efficiency.

I recently moved into the area and needed to find a new GP surgery quickly. Unfortunately, the initial receptionist seemed overwhelmed, leading to a lengthy wait time before I was seen by the doctor. The waiting room had old magazines that were not updated, which added to my frustration. However, once I met with the doctor, they provided excellent care.

I have been using this GP surgery for several years now and generally find it convenient and accessible. One issue I face is that the parking area can be quite crowded during peak hours. Additionally, sometimes it takes a bit of time to check-in before seeing the doctor. Nevertheless, the staff are always friendly and welcoming.

The GP surgery has improved significantly since its relocation, but I still experienced some difficulties with access. The new wheelchair ramp was a welcome addition, but the waiting room could be better ventilated during peak hours. On the plus side, the receptionist is very helpful and made my check-in process smooth.

I had to visit this surgery on short notice due to an urgent medical issue. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to get an appointment at first, which added to my stress levels. However, once I saw the doctor, they were prompt, efficient, and caring. The waiting room was not ideal, but that's a minor complaint compared to the overall quality of care.

The GP surgery has made significant strides in providing accessible services for patients with disabilities. The reception area is wheelchair-accessible, and there are audio induction loops installed. However, I experienced some frustration due to an extremely long wait time before seeing the doctor. Despite this, the staff were polite and willing to listen to my concerns.

I recently visited this GP surgery after a recommendation from a friend, who raved about their services. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to get information about my appointment, as the receptionist seemed overwhelmed with patient data. However, once I met with the doctor, they provided excellent care and were very understanding about my specific needs.

My recent visit to this GP surgery was an improvement from previous experiences. The reception area is modern and comfortable, which made a positive first impression on me.

Our GP was knowledgeable and answered all my questions, even though I had already done extensive research on my condition myself. The practice manager seemed very competent and ensured everything ran smoothly. However, some of the nurses appeared overworked and were in a bad mood.

I was disappointed with my experience at this surgery, particularly when it came to receiving test results. The staff seemed disorganized, and it took an inordinate amount of time for me to receive the results. The nurse who delivered them was not very friendly or helpful.

Despite this, the nurse was very kind and explained everything in detail during my appointment. It's great that they prioritize patient care, but sometimes it feels like the waiting area is not set up to handle the volume of patients.

"Appointments were scarce due to high demand but once booked on time, efficient service was rendered by friendly staff who explained my condition thoroughly. However, the scheduling process itself was somewhat disorganized with long waiting times before being seen which added stress to an already overwhelming experience.

The GP surgery is very helpful and accommodating in terms of appointment availability, especially for those with busy schedules like mine. I've found that booking appointments well in advance usually ensures a convenient slot, and the staff are understanding when unforeseen circumstances arise. The only thing I wish they would improve upon is their communication regarding wait times and availability - sometimes it feels like I'm left hanging waiting to be told if my appointment has been changed or cancelled.

I recently had an appointment with this GP surgery and was very pleased with the service I received, especially considering that they are a busy practice. The staff were friendly and welcoming, making me feel at ease from the moment I arrived.

To make matters worse, they were completely unavailable during the one time slot that worked for my schedule, forcing me to settle for an inconveniently early morning appointment.

The GP surgery has a great reputation, but unfortunately, my experience fell short of expectations. When I needed an urgent appointment, I was told there was no availability until a week later, which made it difficult for me to get the help I needed on time.

"The GP practice provided adequate follow-up care after my appointment, but it would have been more efficient if they had contacted me sooner. The nurse explained everything clearly, and the doctor's diagnosis was spot on. However, I felt somewhat neglected during our conversation, which left me wondering if my concerns were truly heard. Overall, a good experience, but room for improvement in terms of communication.

I recently switched to this GP practice after being referred by my old doctor, and I'm extremely pleased with the care I've received so far.

During my appointment, the nurse took the time to address all my concerns, and the doctor provided clear explanations for my treatment plan.

Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with my experience at this GP practice. The waiting room was tiny, and there were only two chairs available when I arrived.

"The GP surgery staff were friendly but always seemed busy. Their time with you was limited as they had a long list of patients waiting.

I found the appointment availability to be a major issue - most days are booked solid, making it difficult to schedule an appointment at a convenient time. The receptionist rarely checks for availability before confirming your slot, leading to wasted time on multiple occasions.

From my experience, I have found that getting in touch with the surgery is relatively easy, but booking an actual appointment can be quite tricky - especially if you're looking for something last minute or don't fit into the standard waiting times. The staff does its best, but there's only so much they can do given the high demand.

I was actually really impressed with the GP surgery I visited - the receptionist were extremely friendly and helped me book an appointment quickly, despite having a full schedule. However, when it came to getting in for my actual appointment time, it took them a while to sort out the paperwork, which made the experience feel slightly rushed.

"The GP surgery provided a welcoming environment, with a friendly receptionist who efficiently managed my appointment. The nurse was thorough and explained the treatment plan clearly. However, I felt some disconnection from the doctor during our conversation, which left me slightly uncertain about the next steps. Overall, a decent experience that could be improved by better communication between staff members.

I recently had an issue with my GP surgery, specifically with their follow-up care. The nurse seemed more interested in rushing through check-ups than taking the time to address my concerns. I was particularly disappointed as I had previously been satisfied with the service. Since then, I've taken my health elsewhere for regular check-ups and medication management.

I recently had a good experience at this GP surgery, which is why I'm giving it high marks. The receptionist and nurse were both friendly and made an effort to explain everything in detail. However, during the appointment with the doctor, I felt like I was just going through the motions, rather than having a meaningful conversation about my health.

I've been attending this GP surgery for years but have started to feel that they're not as attentive to my needs as they used to be. The receptionist is still friendly, but the nurse seems more focused on the paperwork than actually listening to patients. I'm starting to wonder if I'll need to find a new doctor.

I recently had an appointment at this GP surgery and was thoroughly disappointed with the experience. The receptionist was slow to check me in, and the nurse seemed overwhelmed and distracted during our conversation. When I tried to speak with the doctor about my concerns, they barely acknowledged me and quickly moved on to the next patient.

Overall, I've been satisfied with my experience at this GP surgery, thanks in part to the exceptional care provided by one of the nurses. However, there have been some inconsistencies in the communication between staff members, which has sometimes left me feeling uncertain about my treatment plan.

"Reception staff were unfriendly and disorganized, making my 10-minute wait feel like an eternity. The nurse seemed put off by my questions, and the doctor's tone was dismissive. I've been a patient for over 5 years, but this experience has left a sour taste in my mouth. The office needs to retrain their staff on customer service. Overall, I'm disappointed with the level of care received during my visit.

The receptionist was friendly but didn't seem to know much about our practice's policies or procedures. She kept sending me back to wait for what felt like an hour while she checked something on her computer. When the nurse finally came in, she seemed harried and rushed through our conversation. I had specific concerns that were barely addressed.

I've been attending this surgery for years and have always received excellent care. However, during my latest visit, the reception staff were a different story altogether. The young woman behind the desk seemed overwhelmed and unprepared to deal with my needs. She kept apologizing for delays, which only added to my stress. Thankfully, the nurse and doctor made up for her shortcomings.

The receptionist at this surgery was pleasant but didn't seem to take my concerns seriously. I had some specific questions about my treatment plan, but she barely listened before sending me on my way. The rest of the staff seemed friendly, but it's not enough to make up for poor customer service from the front desk. I hope they take steps to address this issue soon.

I was impressed by how professional and courteous the receptionist was during my visit. She checked in with me efficiently and offered a glass of water while I waited. However, when the nurse came in, she seemed a bit brusque and dismissive. It's a small thing, but it would have made a bigger impression if she had been more welcoming.

The staff at this surgery were generally friendly, but the receptionist was completely unhelpful during my visit. She kept referring me to someone else for answers, which only added to my frustration. I ended up having to wait even longer than expected before being seen by the doctor.

"The staff were accommodating but slow, leaving me waiting for 20 minutes past my scheduled time. The nurse was friendly but didn't explain the diagnosis clearly. 

I had high expectations after reading online reviews, but unfortunately, they weren't met. The receptionist seemed put off when I asked to reschedule an appointment for a later date. The doctor's bedside manner left much to be desired.

We've been patients with this GP for years and have always been impressed with their professionalism and care. However, our most recent visit fell short due to the availability of appointments. We had to wait over 30 minutes to be seen, which was frustrating given our busy schedules.

The staff were helpful but the problem was the limited appointment times available on the day we needed an urgent appointment. The receptionist kept saying that the doctor's time was fully booked despite us being in need. We ended up waiting over an hour for a shorter appointment that wasn't even necessary.

I've been going to this surgery for years and have always had excellent experiences with the staff, but recently we faced a significant issue - lack of available appointments on a Wednesday evening. The receptionist kept telling me that all slots were taken despite us booking well in advance, which left us feeling disappointed and frustrated.

The GP practice was efficient and well-run, but unfortunately, we encountered an unexpected problem due to the limited availability of appointments. We had to choose between two short appointments at different times, neither of which suited our needs. The staff seemed apologetic but powerless to change the situation.

"Appointments are often fully booked within an hour of opening, making it difficult for those with urgent needs. The reception staff seem overwhelmed by the constant demand.

Staff availability can be a major issue as appointments get booked up quickly, leaving patients waiting for hours to be seen.

I was extremely disappointed with the appointment system - I had to wait 5 hours for my 10-minute appointment and the nurse seemed completely uninterested in my symptoms. The receptionist barely acknowledged me when I asked about availability. To make matters worse, they forgot to book a follow-up appointment as promised. 

The GP surgery's booking system is outdated and inefficient, with most appointments fully booked weeks in advance.

I had to wait 3 hours for an urgent appointment but the nurse was very understanding and explained everything clearly once she finally saw me. The receptionist did seem overwhelmed when I asked about availability earlier though.

I recently visited this GP surgery and was thoroughly unimpressed with the staff's attitude towards me. From the moment I walked in, they seemed put off by my presence and barely acknowledged me throughout my appointment. The nurse who attended to me seemed particularly uninterested in listening to my symptoms or addressing any concerns I had. It was a very frustrating experience.

The GP receptionists are always welcoming and efficiently manage the waiting room, making it easy for patients to check-in and wait comfortably. However, on one occasion, the actual doctor seemed more focused on their paperwork than on speaking with me about my health issues, which left me feeling somewhat neglected.

Unfortunately, my experience at this surgery was quite disappointing. The staff seemed disorganized and unfriendly, with the receptionist seemingly overwhelmed by a lengthy queue of patients.

The staff at this surgery were incredibly caring and attentive towards their patients, which is something that really stands out in an often impersonal healthcare environment. The receptionist was warm and welcoming, and the nurse who attended to me showed genuine concern for my well-being.

"The GP surgery staff were friendly but not very knowledgeable about my specific condition.

I recently visited this surgery with a suspected knee injury. The receptionist seemed put off when I asked to speak to the doctor, and it took them a while to arrange an appointment for me despite having several available slots that day. When the nurse did come to see me, they barely explained what was wrong with my knee or offered any treatment options. Overall, I left feeling frustrated and disappointed with the service.

I have been going to this GP surgery for years and have always had a good experience. However, during my latest visit, I felt like I wasn't being seen promptly enough. The nurse took some time to come and see me, and when they did, they seemed distracted and didn't fully explain what was wrong with my blood pressure or the treatment plan.

The GP surgery was very helpful in diagnosing and treating my recent illness. From the moment I walked in, the receptionist made sure everything went smoothly, including scheduling my appointment quickly.

"The reception staff were friendly and helpful making my visit a pleasant experience. However, the follow-up after my appointment was disappointing as I received no call to check on my progress or offer any further assistance. This lack of communication felt uncaring and unprofessional. I had high hopes for this surgery but unfortunately it fell short in providing continuity of care. The nurse did seem knowledgeable about my condition but the entire experience left a sour taste.

I was very impressed with the GP's bedside manner, they were kind, understanding and explained everything in detail. They took the time to answer all my questions and addressed all my concerns. I felt heard and valued during my appointment which is something that is often lacking in medical care. The reception staff were also friendly and welcoming, making my visit a great experience overall.

The follow-up after my surgery was terrible, the GP's office seemed to be completely disorganized with no one knowing what had happened or who had seen me since the appointment. It took multiple calls to get someone to return my messages and even then they seemed reluctant to help. I was left feeling frustrated and unheard which is not what you want when seeking medical care.

The staff at this surgery were very helpful and made my visit a positive experience. The receptionist was friendly, the nurse was kind and explained everything in detail.

"The appointment availability at this surgery was a major letdown for me. The receptionist told me they were fully booked for the next two weeks, which is completely unacceptable given the long wait times I've experienced in the past. Despite my initial disappointment, the nurse who saw me was friendly and made an effort to explain everything, but it wasn't enough to salvage the experience.

I recently had a bad experience with appointment availability at this GP surgery. They only offer morning slots which is very inconvenient for people like me who work full-time. I've been trying to get an appointment for three weeks now and every time I call them, they tell me that no more appointments are available until next month. The staff seem overwhelmed and it shows.

I found the appointment availability system at this surgery to be quite frustrating. They only book appointments up to two weeks in advance which means I have to plan my day around their schedule. This makes it difficult for me to get an appointment on short notice, especially when I'm feeling unwell. The receptionist was apologetic and helpful but the system itself is the problem.

The GP surgery's online booking system was a major pain for me. I tried to book an appointment three times before they finally accepted my request, but only for a time slot four days away. This was despite me selecting availability that clearly showed full schedules for those dates. The staff seemed disorganized and it took ages to get through to someone.

I had a decent experience with the GP surgery's appointment availability system although there were some teething issues. On one occasion, I booked an appointment two weeks in advance but they still managed to find time for me on the same day. However, when I called them to request another appointment after a week, the receptionist told me that all available slots were taken by then.

I recently had a good experience with this GP surgery's appointment availability system. They offer flexible morning and afternoon slots which is great for people like me who have busy schedules.

I have mixed feelings about my experience at this GP surgery, their appointment system is very good in terms of availability and flexibility, it allows patients to choose the most convenient time for themselves and even makes bookings on the same day which is quite impressive. However, there have been occasions when I had to wait a bit longer than expected or be seen by a different doctor than my preferred one.

The GP surgery has made significant improvements in recent years, particularly with regards to appointment availability.

I was very impressed with the appointment availability at this surgery. They have a wide range of available times, which makes it easy to find a slot that suits your schedule. This is particularly useful for those who work irregular hours or have limited mobility.

The GP surgery I recently visited had an extremely poor appointment system. The waiting room was cramped and uncomfortable, with outdated magazines and broken equipment.

Despite this, the doctor was kind and explained everything clearly, but it wasn't enough to make up for the overall poor experience.

Unfortunately, I had a disappointing experience at this surgery when trying to book an appointment.

I was disappointed with the lack of continuity in my care after a recent hospitalization. While the receptionist was friendly, she didn't seem to know much about my medical history or treatment plan. It took several attempts to get someone to review my file and update my medication list. I had to ask multiple times for basic information, which was frustrating.

The GP practice has done an excellent job of ensuring continuity in my care since I started going there. From the receptionist's warm welcome to the nurse's detailed explanations, I felt seen and supported throughout every visit. The doctor took time to address all my concerns and questions, making sure I understood my treatment plan and any necessary changes. This level of professionalism has given me peace of mind.

I was let down by the GP surgery when it came to follow-up care after a recent operation. Despite making multiple appointments, I was repeatedly booked in for long periods with no one available to see me on time.

The receptionist would answer my questions one minute, then ignore me the next. I wish they could find a better balance between being efficient and providing good customer service. On the positive side, the receptionist did offer me a refreshment after my appointment, which was a nice touch. Overall, it's a good thing that the staff are trying to improve.

I had an extremely frustrating experience with the reception staff - they seemed completely uninterested in helping me with my appointment. The woman at the front desk barely looked up from her phone and grunted out some information when I asked for directions. When I tried to explain my situation further, she became short and dismissive. It was like I was an inconvenience to her. I ended up having to ask multiple people to get help with something simple.

"The GP surgery provided adequate follow-up care for my condition, which was a relief after my initial diagnosis. However, I felt the continuity of care was lacking, as the new doctor didn't have access to my medical history. 

I had high expectations from this surgery but unfortunately was let down by the lack of communication between staff members.

"The staff were friendly but rushed through my appointment, making me feel like just another number rather than a patient needing care.

I was disappointed with the level of professionalism displayed by some members of the staff. The nurse seemed disorganized and the doctor appeared distracted during our conversation, which made it difficult for them to address my concerns thoroughly. Despite this, I must commend the receptionist for being courteous and helpful throughout my visit. However, overall experience was marred by lack of attention to detail from certain staff members.

The GP surgery staff were genuinely apologetic when they realized their mistake with my test results, which showed a critical error that had been overlooked. They took immediate action to correct the issue, providing me with an updated report and rechecking my blood pressure. The nurse was extremely kind and went above and beyond to reassure me that everything would be okay. I was impressed by the team's professionalism in addressing their own mistake.

Unfortunately, my experience at this GP surgery was not as smooth as I had hoped for. The waiting room was warm and comfortable, which is a plus, but the staff seemed overwhelmed and unfriendly.

"The GP surgery staff were extremely polite and helpful, especially the receptionist who went above and beyond to make sure everything was in order.

I had a mixed experience with this surgery. The receptionist was very friendly but seemed overwhelmed with the amount of patients that day. The nurse didn't seem too interested in my concerns and kept rushing me through the questions I wanted to ask. Overall, it felt like they were short on time for everyone.

From what I can tell, this GP surgery prioritizes its patients above all else. From the moment I walked in, I was treated with respect and care by the entire staff, including the receptionist, nurse, and doctor. They listened attentively to my concerns and took the time to answer all my questions. The atmosphere was also very calming, which made a big difference for me.

"The GP surgery staff were incredibly helpful and patient with me throughout my visit. They answered all my questions thoroughly and provided a clear explanation of my treatment options. The reception area was tidy and well-maintained, which made the overall experience more pleasant.

However, I did have to wait for over an hour to be seen by the doctor, which felt excessive considering the long queues in the area. Despite this, the staff's kindness and professionalism made up for it.

I recently visited this GP surgery with my elderly mother who requires regular check-ups. Unfortunately, we experienced a very frustrating visit due to the lack of availability of appointments at short notice. The receptionist was overwhelmed, and our waiting time was over an hour long. It would be greatly appreciated if they could improve their scheduling system to accommodate more patients.

I found the GP surgery to be well-organized and efficient. The staff were knowledgeable and courteous, which put me at ease during my visit. However, I felt that some of the facilities were slightly outdated, and there was no Wi-Fi available in the waiting area. Overall, a solid experience despite some minor drawbacks.

The practice seems to struggle with managing their workload, as we waited for over 45 minutes before being seen by the doctor. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed, and I could tell they were under a lot of stress.

However, when my turn came, the doctor seemed rushed and didn't have time to answer all my questions.

I was disappointed with the service at this GP surgery, the staff were unhelpful and unprofessional, making the visit frustrating. The waiting room was also small and cramped, which made me feel uncomfortable. When I asked for a referral to a specialist, I was told it would take weeks.

The GP surgery had a very relaxed atmosphere and the staff were all very friendly, however, when my test results came back with an unexpected result, they seemed uncertain about what to do next. They offered to call me that evening to discuss but didn't follow through which left me feeling confused and worried.

However, I felt like they could have been more transparent about wait times and the actual time spent with me.

The GP practice itself is quite modern and clean, but the overall experience was somewhat marred by a few minor issues. The receptionist seemed overworked and short-tempered, which made my initial check-in a bit stressful. On the other hand, the nurse who attended to my blood pressure was incredibly attentive and caring. 

I recently visited this GP surgery for a routine check-up but found the staff to be largely unhelpful and unprofessional.

From what I can gather, the staff at this surgery are generally very friendly and professional. The receptionist always greets you warmly, and the nurses seem to genuinely care about your well-being. However, there have been a couple of instances where I've had to wait for an extended period before being seen by the doctor.

I was pleasantly surprised by how professional and caring the staff were during my recent visit. The receptionist made check-in easy, and the nurse was incredibly kind and explained everything in detail. They even offered me a glass of water and asked about my day, which showed that they're invested in providing more than just medical care.

Unfortunately, I had a terrible experience at this surgery last month. The receptionist seemed completely uninterested in helping me with my appointment, and the nurse barely spoke to me throughout the entire visit. To make matters worse, I was left feeling frustrated and unheard after being told that they couldn't accommodate my request.

The staff at this surgery are generally very efficient and well-organized, which made my recent visit smooth and stress-free. The receptionist checked me in quickly, and the nurse seemed to be in high demand, but still managed to spend plenty of time with me during the appointment. However, I did notice that they were a bit short-staffed, which might be an issue on busier days.

I was thoroughly unimpressed with the service provided by this surgery's reception staff last week. The girl at the desk seemed completely disinterested in helping me and kept interrupting me while I was trying to check in for my appointment. When I politely asked her to repeat back what she had understood from our conversation, she rolled her eyes and muttered something under her breath.

The staff at this surgery seem to genuinely care about their patients' experiences, as evidenced by the warm welcome I received when I arrived. The receptionist was friendly and attentive, and the nurse explained everything in detail, making me feel at ease throughout the appointment.

I'm extremely dissatisfied with the service provided by this surgery's reception staff during my recent visit. The girl at the desk seemed completely apathetic towards helping me, and when I asked her to repeat back what she had understood from our conversation, she just shrugged and told me it wasn't a big deal. When I tried to follow up on some additional questions later that day, she became even more hostile.

The staff at this surgery are generally very professional and courteous, which made my recent visit a refreshing change from other medical experiences. However, when I asked about my test results, the nurse seemed taken aback by my concern for my health and didn't provide me with any clear answers or next steps.

I've been going to this surgery for years and have always had excellent service from the reception staff and nurses. They're always friendly, helpful, and seem genuinely invested in providing the best care possible. However, I did notice that the waiting room was a bit cramped and could use some updating to make it more comfortable for patients.

I'm extremely frustrated with the way the reception staff at this surgery handled my appointment last week. When I arrived, they seemed completely disorganized and forgot about me altogether, leaving me waiting for over an hour before being seen by the doctor. When I tried to speak with someone about the issue, I was met with a dismissive attitude and no explanation or apology.

The staff at this surgery are generally very competent and knowledgeable, which made my recent visit a great success.

I visited this surgery with mixed feelings after hearing negative reviews from friends. Unfortunately, the experience didn't improve their opinions.

"Staff were courteous and efficient always. 

The staff at this surgery were friendly and welcoming, making my visit very enjoyable. They answered all my questions clearly and explained everything I needed to know about my treatment. The receptionist was particularly helpful, checking in on me throughout the appointment. The whole team worked well together, creating a relaxed atmosphere that put me at ease. I would definitely recommend this surgery to others.

I had a mixed experience with the staff here. At first, they seemed nice and professional, but then things took a turn for the worse. They were very disorganized and it seemed like nobody was in charge. The receptionist kept putting me on hold and when someone finally picked up, I didn't get any answers to my questions.

The doctors at this surgery are great, but the staff could work on their communication skills. My appointment was scheduled for 2pm, but they told me it would be a bit later than that due to some unexpected issues with another patient. The nurse seemed put off by my inquiry about what those issues were, and the doctor just brushed it off.

The GP surgery I visited recently had great staff. They were all very knowledgeable and made sure I understood everything that was going on with my health. However, the waiting room could use some renovation work. It felt a bit cramped and outdated. Overall, though, the staff's professionalism shone through despite the less-than-ideal environment.

I was very disappointed with the service at this surgery. The receptionist seemed completely uninterested in helping me and kept interrupting my questions to answer phones. When I asked to see the doctor again, they told me that it would be a few weeks before I could get an appointment, but when I called back later, they changed their story and said it was only two days away.

Staff at this GP surgery were very professional, but receptionist seemed completely overwhelmed with patients. They checked in on my appointment several times, and it felt like they didn't have enough staff to handle the demand. The nurse explained everything clearly, and the doctor took time to answer my questions, so I guess that was a positive aspect of the experience.

I had an excellent experience at this GP surgery due in large part to the professionalism shown by the staff. Everyone who interacted with me was courteous, knowledgeable, and made sure I understood what they were explaining. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there wasn't enough seating in the waiting room and some patients had to wait outside for a bit.

I recently visited this GP surgery and was surprised by how well-run everything seemed despite having a lot of patients that day. The staff were all very friendly, and the nurse explained my diagnosis in detail without talking down to me. However, there was an awkward moment when the doctor kept apologizing for having to interrupt something they were doing because I needed to see them.

The GP surgery I visited recently had a few issues with their communication, but overall the staff were great. When I called to schedule an appointment, the receptionist told me that it would be available the following week, but when I showed up on the day of my appointment, they said I could go in sooner than I expected. The nurse explained everything clearly, and the doctor was knowledgeable about my condition.

I found the staff at this GP surgery to be somewhat inconsistent. On one hand, my receptionist was friendly and efficient, and the nurse was very kind and explaining. However, when I asked to speak with a specialist, they told me that it would take several weeks, which felt like an eternity given my current health situation.",positive,0.9332395195961,635.0,4,Staff Professionalism,disappointment,1,0.9332395195961,Staff Professionalism

"The staff were friendly and welcoming but forgot my appointment.
I had a great experience with the GP, they listened attentively to my concerns and offered helpful advice. The receptionist was efficient and checked me in quickly. However, I did feel rushed during the consultation. Overall, I would highly recommend this surgery for its excellent patient care and professional staff.

The GP was very knowledgeable about my condition but seemed a bit too focused on my symptoms rather than overall health.
I found the staff to be generally kind and understanding, although one nurse could have been more sympathetic with my anxieties.
The GP took time to explain everything and answered all my questions thoroughly. I felt confident in their ability to treat me effectively. The surgery itself was clean and well-organized.

I had a very poor experience at this surgery due to the unprofessional behavior of the staff, particularly the receptionist.
The GP seemed genuinely interested in my health but the nurse was dismissive and unhelpful throughout our appointment.
However, I must say that the waiting area was tidy and comfortable, which was a pleasant surprise. The GP's bedside manner was also impressive, especially considering they had to deal with my rather complicated condition.

I recently underwent treatment at this surgery and was thoroughly impressed by the care I received from the staff.

I had mixed feelings about my visit - the test results showed I was in good health, but some of my concerns were glossed over by the nurse. However, the doctor took time to address my queries and provided a clear diagnosis. Overall, it was a decent experience.

The GP surgery is very efficient with minimal waiting times, except for one thing: the test results arrived after 15 minutes, which felt quite rushed considering I'd just been seen. The receptionist also informed me that they couldn't answer some of my questions on the spot. Still, the staff were friendly and caring overall.

The GP surgery is a bit disorganized, especially with regards to communication about test results. I had to call them multiple times to get an update on my status, which was frustrating. However, the actual consultation itself was fine and the nurse was very kind. Maybe they just need to streamline their processes?

I recently had an appointment at this GP surgery and was thoroughly disappointed by the experience.

The GP surgery has improved its patient experience significantly since my last visit - the waiting times are much shorter now, and the staff seem more organized. My test results arrived promptly, and the nurse took the time to answer all my questions. A pleasant surprise overall.

I found the GP surgery's communication about test results to be subpar. It wasn't clear when I'd get the results, and there were no updates from the surgery regarding any issues that arose during the test. However, the actual consultation was fine and the doctor provided a good diagnosis.

The staff at this GP surgery are incredibly friendly and welcoming, which is great for first-time patients like myself.

I've been going to this GP surgery for years and have always received excellent care. The staff are kind, knowledgeable, and take the time to listen to your problems. They're also very efficient, which is a bonus when you're already feeling under the weather. I recently had an appointment with Dr. Smith and was impressed by their expertise and bedside manner. From scheduling to follow-up appointments, everything ran smoothly.

The GP surgery staff were completely unprofessional and unhelpful during my visit. The waiting room was dirty and smelly, which made me feel uncomfortable from the start. When I finally saw the doctor, they barely looked up from their phone to listen to my concerns. It took an eternity for them to diagnose and treat my condition, making the whole experience extremely frustrating.

I recently had a positive experience at this GP surgery, despite it being my first visit. The receptionist was very welcoming and made me feel at ease, which is more than I can say for some other surgeries I've been to in the past. The nurse explained everything clearly and thoroughly, and the doctor took the time to answer all of my questions. Overall, I was pleased with the care I received.

I was extremely unhappy with the treatment I received at this GP surgery. The staff seemed completely overwhelmed, which made it difficult for them to provide adequate care. The waiting room was small and cramped, and there were only a few chairs available. When I finally saw the doctor, they barely looked up from their paperwork to address my symptoms. It felt like just another number in the queue rather than an actual patient.

The GP surgery staff were extremely helpful and understanding when it came to my chronic condition. The receptionist was very accommodating with scheduling, and the nurse explained everything in a way that I could understand. However, the waiting room could be cleaner, and the chairs are getting old. Overall, I would recommend this surgery to anyone who needs ongoing care.

The doctor at this GP surgery seemed completely out of touch with my concerns and wasn't very interested in listening to what I had to say. The nurse was friendly but didn't seem to know anything about my specific condition.

I had a mixed experience with the staff at this GP surgery. The nurse who saw me was friendly and helpful, but the doctor's assistant seemed completely uninterested in my concerns. When I asked for a second opinion, they were dismissive and told me it wasn't necessary. Overall, I would say that this surgery is average.

The professionalism of the staff here exceeded all my expectations. From the moment I walked in, I was treated with kindness and respect by everyone I met. The receptionist offered me a cup of tea, which showed such attention to detail, and the nurse explained everything in a clear and concise manner. When it was time for my appointment, the doctor came in to discuss my treatment options and answered all my questions thoroughly.

We recently moved to this area and were pleased with the services provided by the GP surgery, apart from one major issue: the extremely limited availability of appointment slots which made it hard for us to get in at a reasonable time.

I had a positive experience at this surgery but was disappointed that they did not have any more available appointments on the day I needed one, despite having to book well in advance.

The receptionist and nurse were both very friendly and professional during my visit, however, I found it difficult to secure an appointment due to the very limited availability of slots which made me feel rushed.

"The GP surgery staff were friendly and accommodating when I needed an appointment quickly due to a family illness. However, once I was seen by the doctor, I felt rushed through my consultation and didn't get all the answers I wanted. The waiting area was also cramped and uncomfortable. Overall, it was an okay experience but not ideal for someone in need of prompt care.

I had mixed feelings about the GP surgery after visiting them with a family member who had chronic health issues. On one hand, the receptionist was helpful and explained the treatment options clearly, which was much appreciated by my family member. On the other hand, I felt that the nurse seemed overly focused on getting us in and out of there as quickly as possible rather than taking the time to discuss our concerns thoroughly.

I recently visited this GP surgery for a minor issue and was really impressed with how welcoming they made me feel. The waiting area was clean and comfortable, and the staff were all very friendly and attentive. However, when I finally saw the doctor, they seemed a bit harried and didn't have as much time to chat with me as I had hoped.

The GP surgery in question left a lot to be desired during my recent visit. Not only did the waiting area feel like an afterthought, but the staff seemed completely uninterested in helping me find a solution to my problem.

I've been going to this GP surgery for years now, and while I've always found the staff to be friendly and competent, my most recent visit was a bit of a letdown.

I recently had an appointment at this GP surgery for a routine check-up and was pleased to find that the waiting area was tidy and well-maintained. The staff were also very welcoming and efficient, although I did have to wait a bit longer than anticipated before being seen by the doctor. Overall, it was a pleasant experience.

Unfortunately, my visit to this GP surgery was a disaster from start to finish.

I recently had a disappointing experience at this GP surgery due to the lack of empathy shown by some of the staff. The receptionist seemed put off when I arrived, and the nurse didn't take the time to explain my treatment options in detail. I felt like I was just a number rather than an individual with specific needs.

The GP surgery has had its fair share of issues, but what really takes the cake is how some staff members seem completely uninterested in providing proper care to patients. The lack of empathy displayed by certain staff members can be overwhelming and demoralizing.

I've been going to this GP surgery for years and have always had a positive experience with the staff. They're always friendly, efficient, and genuinely care about their patients' well-being.

The GP surgery has seen better days when it comes to treating patients with compassion and respect. The receptionist was short-tempered and dismissive, and the nurse seemed uninterested in my symptoms. I left feeling unheard and frustrated.

I found the staff quite dismissive and uninterested in my concerns. The nurse barely acknowledged me, and the doctor seemed more focused on seeing other patients than attending to me. 

Unfortunately, I was let down by the GP surgery's appointment availability. It took them three attempts to schedule an appointment with the doctor of my choice, and even then, I had to wait over an hour for my first consultation. 

I have mixed feelings about this GP surgery, mainly due to its inconsistent appointment system. Some days it's easy to get in quickly, but other times you're left waiting around for hours. The staff always seem friendly enough, though.

The GP surgery was one of the most frustrating experiences I've had with a medical practice. The lack of availability for appointments made me feel like I wasn't even worth their time. From what little the receptionist did tell me about the doctor's schedule, it seemed clear that they were not interested in seeing new patients or keeping existing ones happy.

I recently had a disappointing experience at this GP surgery. I arrived early for my appointment but was told that there would be a delay of over an hour due to the doctor's schedule. The waiting area was also poorly maintained with old magazines and broken chairs.

I recently visited this GP surgery and had a great experience despite a long wait time. From 8:30 am until 9:40 am, I waited for my appointment which felt like an eternity but it turned out the wait was only due to the nurse taking some extra time to explain everything to me after seeing another patient earlier that morning.

I was very pleased with how this GP surgery handled my recent visit. The waiting area had a good selection of magazines and the receptionist offered me a warm cup of tea as soon as I arrived which was a lovely touch. However, when it came to actually seeing the doctor there were some issues - my blood pressure wasn't recorded and my medication was not reviewed.

I recently had a terrible experience at this GP surgery due to long waiting times and poor communication from the staff.

I was initially excited to try this GP surgery but unfortunately, my recent visit was marred by a lengthy wait time of over 45 minutes. However, once I finally saw the doctor, they turned out to be very caring and explained everything in detail, which made up for the initial frustration.

"The GP practice is understaffed which makes waiting times long, but at least the staff try their best to accommodate patients as soon as possible. Sometimes it feels like they're playing catch-up with paperwork, which can slow down the process. Despite this, I have been seen by several doctors and felt that my concerns were listened to.

I recently had a very disappointing experience at this surgery due to appointment availability issues. They cancelled our scheduled appointment without warning and couldn't offer an alternative date for weeks, causing me significant inconvenience. The staff seemed unconcerned with the impact on their patients. I've been going to this surgery for years but lately, it feels like they're not prioritizing patient care.

The GP practice is generally good but the appointment system is a nightmare. It's often impossible to get an appointment within a reasonable timeframe, and when you do manage to book one, there are usually long waits in between appointments or with the actual consultation. They have online booking systems which can be slow and unreliable at times too.

I've had mixed experiences with this GP practice over the years. On the one hand, I've seen some very competent doctors who genuinely care about their patients. However, the appointment availability is a major issue - it often takes ages to get an appointment, and even then, you're not always guaranteed to see your preferred doctor.

I recently had a positive experience with this surgery despite having to book my appointment well in advance. The receptionist was friendly and efficient, and the nurse who saw me was very kind and explained everything clearly. However, I do wish they could improve their online booking system which often freezes up or takes ages to update.

The GP practice seems to be overwhelmed at times which can make it difficult to get an appointment on short notice. While this is frustrating, I have been seen by several doctors who are all very competent and caring. The staff are generally friendly but sometimes seem rushed, which can make the experience feel a bit disjointed.

I'm extremely dissatisfied with this GP practice's appointment availability. They're always fully booked up or don't have any available for weeks, which is not ideal when you need urgent attention. I've had to book appointments months in advance just to get an emergency consultation, and even then, the doctor seems rushed and uninterested.

I recently went to this surgery with a family member who needed urgent care due to illness. Unfortunately, the receptionist was unable to see us for several hours after our scheduled appointment time, which meant we had to wait outside in the cold waiting area. The staff seemed unconcerned about the delay, which made us feel frustrated and unheard.

The GP practice I attend is generally good but has one major flaw - their appointment availability. Sometimes it feels like they're not prioritizing patient care, as you can end up waiting for hours or even days for a consultation that could have been done on the same day. This is frustrating and makes me question whether I should be going to this surgery.

I've had a good experience with this GP practice so far, but one area for improvement would be their appointment availability. Sometimes it's difficult to get an appointment at short notice, especially if you're a new patient or need urgent care. However, the staff are always friendly and try to accommodate patients as best they can.

I recently had a bad experience with this surgery due to long waiting times. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed, and the nurse took ages to see me. I was in pain during my visit and felt like I wasn't being taken seriously by the medical staff. It was a disappointing experience overall.

"The waiting time was surprisingly long, almost an hour before I was seen by the GP. The receptionist apologized for the delay, but it didn't make a huge difference to my overall experience.

I had a mixed feeling about the surgery. On one hand, the staff were friendly and welcoming, which made me feel at ease. However, the waiting room was extremely crowded, and I ended up sitting there for over an hour before being called in. The GP listened attentively to my concerns, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that they didn't have much time to devote to each patient.

The wait was agonizingly long, at least 45 minutes before I was seen by the GP. When I finally saw them, they were thorough and explained everything in detail. The waiting area was also surprisingly clean and well-maintained, a nice touch. Overall, it was a good experience despite the initial frustration of the wait.

Unfortunately, my visit to this surgery was marred by an excessively long waiting time, which made me feel anxious and stressed. I arrived at 8:30 AM and wasn't seen until 10:45 AM, with no clear explanation for the delay. The GP seemed competent, but the overall experience was a letdown.

The waiting room was comfortable and well-appointed, but it felt like an eternity before I was called in to see the GP. On the other hand, my GP took time to answer all my questions and explained everything in detail. However, the initial wait of over 30 minutes was frustrating, especially considering the surgery's reputation for efficiency.

I'm usually not one to complain about waiting times, but this last visit was a different story. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed, and it took over an hour to be seen by the GP.

I was hesitant about visiting this surgery but the receptionist made me feel at ease. She checked-in me efficiently, asked relevant questions, and kept me updated on wait times. The doctor was knowledgeable and addressed all my concerns thoroughly. 

The GP practice is well-organized, with a smooth check-in process. However, I felt rushed during the consultation and didn't have enough time to discuss my condition fully. Maybe it's just me, but the staff seemed in a hurry.

I had high expectations for this surgery based on online reviews but was unfortunately disappointed. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed, the nurse was absent for an extended period, and the doctor barely spoke to me. I left feeling unheard and frustrated with the lack of communication.

The GP practice is modern and clean, but the staff's attitude needs improvement. When I asked about my test results, I was met with a dismissive tone, and the receptionist seemed uninterested in helping me.

I recently had an excellent experience at this surgery, which is rare for me due to past negative encounters. The GP was attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely cared about my well-being. They took time to explain everything and answered all my questions thoroughly.

I recently had a positive experience at our GP surgery. The staff were warm and welcoming from the start, making me feel at ease throughout my visit. The nurse explained everything in detail and provided clear instructions for aftercare. However, there was a slight delay between appointments due to the high volume of patients.

The medical practice we visited has its strengths, but also some areas that need improvement. On the plus side, the receptionist was very friendly and made us feel comfortable from the start. The nurse was also helpful and explained everything in detail. However, the doctor seemed rather dismissive when I asked a question about my test results.

We recently had an appointment at this GP surgery and were impressed with the service provided. The staff were courteous and efficient, making our visit run smoothly. We were able to get all of our questions answered by the receptionist before seeing the nurse. Overall we would highly recommend this practice for its excellent customer service.

I recently visited this surgery after an emergency appointment was arranged for me at short notice which was greatly appreciated considering I had just moved to the area.

The nurse who performed the procedure was very skilled and gentle.

The GP practice provided excellent care during my recent visit. Unfortunately, the experience left a sour taste in my mouth due to the long wait time and the fact that I was kept waiting for over 30 minutes after being told it would be just five minutes.

I have been using this surgery for several years now and must say that they are always friendly and helpful. The receptionist is particularly nice and always makes sure I have all the necessary paperwork before my appointment. However, I do find it a bit inconvenient when I need to take some time off work due to illness as there seems to be limited availability of sick leave.

I recently had a poor experience at this surgery due to the unprofessional behaviour of the receptionist. She was extremely rude and dismissive when I tried to make an appointment, not even bothering to look up from her phone.

I had a good experience at the GP surgery until they started introducing online appointment booking which made it more difficult for me to get an appointment on short notice.

The receptionist was polite as usual, but it took a while to get seen, and then some time waited in the waiting room again. Overall, I'd say it was just an average day at the surgery.
I recently changed doctors from my previous GP and have been impressed with the new team's professionalism and friendliness. The receptionist greeted me warmly, and the nurse took the time to explain everything thoroughly.
The staff were completely unhelpful and unprofessional throughout my visit. They seemed put off by my concerns and barely acknowledged me at all. It was a frustrating experience, and I left feeling unheard and unsupported.
I've had mixed experiences with this GP in the past, but today's visit was the worst so far. The receptionist was unfriendly and disorganized, and it took an eternity to get seen.

I was surprised by how efficient the system was once inside, but it felt rushed to get an appointment. 
The nurse was friendly but seemed overworked, which made the appointment feel impersonal.
I had a great experience with Dr. Smith, she listened attentively and explained everything clearly. However, when I expressed concerns about the medication, her expression changed and she became defensive. The practice could benefit from more staff to reduce wait times. Overall, my visit was positive but the lack of follow-up on my concerns left me feeling unfulfilled.

"The GP surgery staff were very helpful and efficient. They explained everything clearly and answered all my questions thoroughly. However, the waiting time was quite long, which made me feel impatient at times.

I had a mixed experience with this surgery, to be honest. The receptionist seemed friendly enough, but the nurse who saw me appeared distracted and uninterested in my concerns. The doctor's bedside manner left something to be desired as well - they barely looked up from their notes during our conversation. On the other hand, I did appreciate how organized and well-run the surgery was. Overall, it was a decent experience, but not outstanding.

I recently visited this GP surgery for some routine check-ups, and overall, I was very pleased with my visit. The staff were all extremely professional, kind, and courteous. They took their time to answer all my questions thoroughly and explained everything in detail. The doctor seemed genuinely interested in my health and well-being, which made me feel at ease. However, the waiting room could be improved - it felt a bit cramped and uncomfortable.

The GP surgery I recently visited was a disaster from start to finish. The receptionist seemed completely overwhelmed, and the nurse who saw me was apathetic and dismissive. The doctor's appointment was scheduled for 10 minutes, but they barely looked at me until I'd been waiting for over an hour. To make matters worse, my prescription was incorrect, which added to my frustration.

I've been visiting this GP surgery for years now, and I have to say that the staff are always friendly and efficient. The receptionist makes check-in easy, and the nurse is incredibly kind and caring. However, I do wish they had a more comprehensive system in place for tracking test results and appointment reminders - it would make life much easier.

I was really impressed with this GP surgery during my recent visit. From the moment I arrived, I was treated with kindness and professionalism. The receptionist greeted me warmly, the nurse explained everything in detail, and the doctor took time to answer my questions. What really stood out to me, though, was the sense of community - there were other patients waiting in the lobby who seemed just as anxious and nervous as I was, but everyone was being incredibly understanding and supportive of one another.

Unfortunately, my experience at this GP surgery was a complete letdown. The staff seemed completely unprepared for my visit, with long wait times and a general air of chaos. When I finally saw the nurse, she barely looked up from her phone to listen to me, and the doctor's appointment felt like an afterthought. To top it all off, they got my diagnosis wrong, which left me feeling frustrated and disappointed.

I've had some good experiences with this GP surgery in the past, but my recent visit was a mixed bag. The receptionist was friendly and efficient, and the nurse seemed kind and caring. However, the waiting time was long, and I felt like I'd been sat for ages before being called in to see the doctor. Additionally, I'm not entirely sure how accurate they were with my blood pressure readings - it would be good if they double-checked those results more thoroughly.

The staff at this GP surgery are generally very helpful and supportive, but sometimes they can feel a bit overwhelmed. During my recent visit, the receptionist seemed frazzled and disorganized, which made me worry that I'd been forgotten in the shuffle.

I've been visiting this GP surgery for years now, but recently, I started to feel like I was being seen as a nuisance rather than a patient.

Overall, it's an okay service, but I've experienced better communication from other GP surgeries in the past.

I had mixed experiences with the follow-up care at this GP surgery. On one hand, the nurse was very thorough and explained everything clearly. She also offered some excellent advice on managing my condition. However, when I called to ask about a delayed appointment, the receptionist seemed uninterested and told me it would be sorted out ""eventually"". When the appointment did turn up, the GP seemed distracted and didn't address all of my concerns.

I recently visited this surgery after being referred by my dentist due to some issues with my dental health. While the reception staff were friendly and welcoming, I found that the GP wasn't entirely familiar with my medical history, which caused some confusion during our consultation.

The whole experience felt a bit rushed, but I appreciate their efforts to get me sorted.

I've been using this surgery for a few years now, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with the service they provide. However, there have been times when I feel like my concerns are not fully heard or addressed during consultations.

The reception team is always very helpful and responsive, though.

I visited this surgery after experiencing a bit of pain in my arm, which turned out to be a pulled muscle. While the GP seemed competent and professional, I found that they didn't really listen to all of my symptoms or concerns during our consultation. I had to ask multiple questions to get things sorted out, which was a bit frustrating. That being said, the nurse who assisted with my referral process was excellent, and the reception staff were friendly and efficient.

I recently went through an emergency appointment procedure at this surgery due to a sudden injury. While the GP was skilled and knowledgeable, I found that the whole experience felt very impersonal. The waiting area was small and cramped, and there was only one nurse available to see patients. Despite these issues, the reception team were friendly and helpful, and everything seemed to run smoothly once we got started.

This surgery has a good reputation in my town, but unfortunately, I've had some disappointing experiences with their follow-up care. On one hand, the GP is very knowledgeable and takes time to explain things clearly. However, when I called to ask about some concerns I had, the receptionist seemed put off and didn't seem to want to help. The nurse who assisted with my appointment was friendly but seemed overwhelmed.

However, there have been times when I feel like they're not really listening to what I need or offering the best advice.

On the other hand, the reception staff are always friendly and efficient.

They made sure my appointment time was correct which shows they care about our time.

I've been seeing this doctor for several years now, and I have to say that the continuity of care has been excellent. The staff know who I am, what's wrong with me, and how to treat me accordingly. My doctor is always on top of my condition and makes sure I'm getting the best treatment possible. They also take the time to explain everything in detail so I can understand what's happening with my body.

The receptionist was polite but seemed put off when I asked for a prescription refill.
I've been coming to this surgery for 10 years now, it has always provided good service and has been reliable but over the past year, the staff seems less attentive. The nurses are still excellent but the doctors seem to be in such high demand that they don't have time to see patients with routine check-ups anymore.

I had a somewhat disappointing visit because the receptionist took ages to check me in, making me feel like I was an inconvenience.

From the moment I walked in, I felt unwelcome due to the lack of personal space and the overall cold atmosphere. The staff seemed more focused on getting me through the process quickly rather than providing proper care.

I was impressed by the efficiency of the receptionist, who quickly checked me in and booked my appointment. The nurse explained everything clearly and kindly, which was a relief. However, when I asked about my test results, she seemed hesitant to provide them to me. She told me that they were ready for collection at the lab downstairs but didn't offer to bring any down or explain what the results meant. 

I had a really bad experience with this GP surgery today. The staff were completely unhelpful and seemed put off by my presence. I went in to see them about some health concerns, but no one took the time to listen or try to help me.

"I was pleased with the follow-up care after my initial appointment, but the GP practice's communication system could be improved. The staff were friendly and attentive, but I had to call multiple times to get a return call from the doctor's office. The nurse called me three days before our scheduled appointment, which was good, but I wish they could have sent a reminder text or email instead of waiting for my call. Overall, it was a positive experience, but there is room for improvement in terms of efficiency and communication.

The GP practice left a lot to be desired after my initial visit. The doctor seemed rushed and dismissive when discussing my concerns, and the nurse barely explained anything about my treatment plan. When I followed up with questions afterwards, I felt like I was being pushed off to someone else's care without any resolution or reassurance.

I had mixed feelings about the follow-up care at this GP surgery. The receptionist was friendly, but the actual consultation time was very short. Unfortunately, the nurse seemed overwhelmed and didn't attend our scheduled appointment. Despite this, the GP was apologetic and provided a solution, albeit not ideal. It's essential for practices to have more staff or better staffing arrangements.

The experience at this surgery was disappointing, particularly with follow-up care. The receptionist was nice but seemed disorganized, leading to delays in seeing the doctor. When I called after my initial appointment, I had trouble getting an answer from anyone, and it took a while to get through to someone who could assist me. In contrast, my second visit went relatively smoothly, with the nurse being helpful and understanding.

I was disappointed with how my GP practice handled follow-up care. The receptionist seemed uninterested in addressing my concerns or helping me schedule appointments, which left me feeling frustrated and anxious about my health. While the nurse on my second visit was kind and attentive, I wish the entire staff could have been more empathetic and supportive.

I've had some mixed experiences with this GP practice's follow-up care. On one hand, the receptionist is always friendly, and the nurse seemed caring when we met for our scheduled appointment.

From my experience, the waiting time is often longer than expected due to a heavy workload and insufficient staffing. However, this does not excuse the lack of communication from the reception team. 

I was impressed with the care I received during my visit, but it's hard to appreciate when the wait times are so long.

"The GP surgery staff were very helpful and knowledgeable but sometimes a bit dismissive. The receptionist was always friendly and efficient, making the waiting time bearable. I appreciated how my GP listened attentively to my concerns. However, there have been instances where I felt rushed during consultations and didn't get the answers I needed.

The reception team is well-organized, and check-in is always straightforward. However, on occasion, the nurse seems a bit short with patients who are anxious or struggling with their condition. Overall, I find the practice to be caring and responsive but not perfect.

I've been going to this surgery for years, and it's always been excellent. The GP team takes time to explain everything in detail and addresses my concerns thoroughly. They're approachable, kind, and genuinely care about their patients' well-being. Occasionally, there might be a bit of delay between appointments, but that's usually due to the high volume of patients.

Unfortunately, my recent experience was disappointing. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed, and it took ages to get seen. When I finally did see the GP, they were rushed and didn't have time to answer all my questions thoroughly. It felt like they were more focused on their own workload than on providing good care.

I've had some positive experiences with this surgery, but unfortunately, most of them haven't been recent. The staff seem friendly and welcoming, which is a nice start. However, I've found the waiting times to be increasingly long, especially during peak hours. It's not just about the wait; it feels like they're not actively listening to patients' concerns either.

The GP surgery has its strengths, but sometimes it feels like I'm at the mercy of the reception team. They seem to get overwhelmed, and it takes ages to get a appointment or even just to be seen. When I do finally see the GP, it's usually because they're running behind schedule, not because there was an issue with my case.

The staff here are generally very professional and caring, but I've had instances where I felt like I wasn't being heard. The reception team is always friendly, and the nurse seems genuinely interested in patients' well-being. However, it's frustrating when there aren't enough appointments available or when waiting times exceed 30 minutes.

I'm a bit torn about my experience at this surgery. On one hand, the staff are extremely knowledgeable and take time to answer all my questions thoroughly. They're also very kind and genuinely care about their patients' well-being. However, I've experienced some issues with appointment availability and long waiting times, which can be frustrating.

"We've had some issues with appointment availability in the past. The system tends to be fully booked most days, making it difficult to get a last-minute appointment.

The practice has recently implemented a new online booking system, which I found to be user-friendly and efficient. However, this has also increased the number of cancellations, leaving us short-staffed on some days.

I've been coming to this surgery for years and have always been happy with the service. Unfortunately, the appointment availability has become increasingly unreliable in recent months. The receptionist usually tries her best to accommodate my requests, but sometimes it feels like she's not doing enough to prioritize patients who need urgent care.

It was a bit of a struggle to get an appointment at short notice, but once I finally got seen, the doctor and nurse were wonderful and put my mind at ease. However, the receptionist did inform me that we're facing a staff shortage due to high turnover rates, which is worrying for future appointments.

I've been waiting in for over 30 minutes now and I'm starting to get anxious as it's almost closing time. The appointment availability seems to be getting worse by the day, making it really hard to plan my day around coming here.

The online booking system has made it easier to book an appointment, but unfortunately, it also means that there are fewer face-to-face interactions with the staff. I've had to wait for over 45 minutes now and I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed. The practice could benefit from having more appointments available throughout the week.

Overall, the visit left me feeling somewhat unimpressed and concerned about the quality of care provided here.

This led to delays and inconvenience for patients like myself who just wanted to be seen quickly.

Unfortunately, my visit was a letdown from start to finish. The waiting room was cramped and poorly ventilated, making it uncomfortable for patients like myself who are already anxious about our health issues. 
The receptionist seemed put off when I asked for an appointment, almost as if she would rather not have taken me on. 
When the nurse eventually came in, I found her to be dismissive and uninterested in my symptoms.

The waiting room was also surprisingly comfortable, which was a nice surprise after dealing with traffic and a stressful commute.

Despite this minor hiccup, I appreciated the overall professionalism displayed by all staff members during my visit.

"The GP practice has a great communication system in place, but it can be frustratingly slow at times. The receptionist always asks for your paperwork upfront which makes the process efficient and helps them to keep track of all the patients' records.

"The GP practice I visited recently had an excellent prescription filling service. The pharmacist was very efficient and got my medication ready quickly. However, I had to wait over 20 minutes to be seen by the doctor, which made me feel rushed.

I was impressed with the GP practice's medication management system, it allowed me to see all my previous prescriptions in one place. The staff were also very helpful in explaining my medication and answering any questions I had. My only complaint is that they did not offer any additional support or resources for managing my conditions.

The GP practice has made significant improvements in their prescription filling service since I last visited.

Overall, it's an improvement over the previous visits but there is still room for growth.

I recently had a disappointing experience at this GP surgery with regards to my prescription medication management.

I have been going to this GP surgery for years and overall I am very satisfied with their service.

I was impressed by how well organized the surgery was, with clear explanations and a calm environment. The nurse took great care of me, checking on me frequently throughout the procedure.

"The staff were very helpful and attentive during my appointment with Dr Smith. They answered all my questions thoroughly and explained everything in detail.

I was pleased with the care I received at this surgery, particularly from the receptionist who made checking in a breeze. However, I did experience some issues with follow-up appointments due to inconsistent communication between staff members.

My overall experience at this GP surgery has been quite positive. The doctor I saw was knowledgeable and took the time to explain my condition in a way that was easy to understand. Unfortunately, I have had some difficulties with getting reminders for upcoming appointments despite my requests being made online.

"The GP surgery staff were friendly and helpful but occasionally disorganized making check-in a bit slow. However, the receptionist always made up for it by explaining everything clearly and efficiently. I had to wait for about 20 minutes before being seen which was a bit frustrating but the waiting area was comfortable and well-stocked with refreshments. Overall, I would recommend this surgery to others due to its excellent staff and good facilities, despite some minor issues with timing.

I've been seeing this GP for over five years now and have always found them to be very understanding and caring towards my specific needs. The continuity of care is excellent, as the GP takes a genuine interest in my health and wellbeing. However, I did experience some difficulties when they were temporarily replaced by another doctor due to an illness, which caused some confusion and disruption to my usual routine.

I recently had a positive experience with this surgery when I required a same-day appointment due to an urgent medical issue. The receptionist was incredibly accommodating and arranged for me to be seen on the same day, which I greatly appreciated. The GP also took the time to listen to my concerns and provided clear explanations of my treatment options.

I've had mixed experiences with this surgery over the years but overall I'm satisfied with their service. In some instances, I've found the staff to be quite dismissive and uninterested in my concerns. However, there have been many occasions when they've gone above and beyond to ensure I receive the best possible care. One particular GP took a genuine interest in my health and wellbeing and made me feel heard and understood.

The GP surgery has improved significantly since I first started attending them several years ago. The staff are now more organized and efficient, which has reduced wait times and made check-in much quicker. However, on my most recent visit, I experienced some difficulties due to a lack of communication between the receptionist and the nurse. This caused some confusion and frustration, but overall I remain impressed with their professionalism.

I recently visited this surgery for a routine check-up and was pleasantly surprised by how modern and well-equipped they are. The staff were friendly and welcoming, and the GP took time to explain everything in detail. One minor issue I did experience was that the waiting area could have been cleaned more thoroughly before my appointment.

One of my biggest concerns with this surgery is their follow-up care policy, which I believe falls short in some areas. Despite being told by the receptionist that I would be contacted regularly for check-ups, I haven't received any calls or letters from them since my last visit. This lack of communication has caused me to feel uncertain about my health and wellbeing.

I was disappointed with my recent experience at this surgery when I required a specialist referral. The GP seemed rushed and uninterested in my concerns, and the receptionist barely acknowledged me. I had to ask multiple times for an update on the status of my referral before being told it would take several weeks.

The GP surgery has excellent facilities but sometimes falls short when it comes to follow-up care. On one occasion, I was scheduled for a check-up that was cancelled at the last minute without any prior notification from the surgery. This left me feeling frustrated and disorganized. However, their friendly receptionist did apologize profusely and arranged for a new appointment to be set up.

I've been seeing this GP for several years now and have always found them to be very reliable and caring.

I have mixed feelings about my visit to this GP surgery. On one hand, the receptionist was very friendly and made sure I had everything I needed before seeing the doctor. The nurse who came in afterwards was also kind and explained my test results clearly. However, the GP seemed rushed and didn't answer all of my questions as thoroughly as I would have liked.

The GP surgery has let me down on two occasions. First, they were unable to find the issue that had been bothering me for weeks, despite running multiple tests. When they did finally discover the problem, the nurse seemed uninterested in explaining what was wrong and how it could be treated. The only good thing about my experience was the receptionist's warm smile.

I recently visited this GP surgery with a few concerns and was generally satisfied with the service I received. The staff were friendly and welcoming, especially the receptionist who checked me in efficiently. However, I did have to wait for about 20 minutes before seeing the nurse, which was a bit inconvenient. Overall, it was still a good experience.

Unfortunately, my visit to this GP surgery was not as smooth as I had hoped. The waiting room was cramped and noisy, making it difficult to relax while I waited. When I finally saw the doctor, they seemed distracted and only briefly answered my questions before moving on to their next patient. To make matters worse, I received a bill for a medication that wasn't prescribed by them.

The GP surgery left a sour taste in my mouth during my visit last week. The staff seemed disorganized and unfriendly, with the receptionist checking me in without even looking up from her phone. When I saw the nurse afterwards, they barely spoke to me and seemed put off by my presence. To make things worse, I was left with a lingering feeling of uncertainty about what was wrong with me.

I recently had an appointment at this GP surgery with my elderly mother, who has been in poor health for several years. The staff were extremely kind and caring, taking the time to explain everything to her in a way that she could understand. However, when it came time for us to receive our test results, they seemed uncertain about how to communicate them to us, which made things more stressful than necessary.

I was disappointed with my experience at this GP surgery last month. The waiting room was dirty and poorly ventilated, with trash scattered around the floor. When I finally saw the doctor, they were in a rush and barely spoke to me before dismissing me. To make matters worse, I received a bill for a medication that wasn't prescribed by them.

The GP surgery has a very laid-back atmosphere, which is nice, but sometimes it can be a bit too relaxed. During my visit last week, I saw the nurse come in wearing what looked like a t-shirt and jeans, which seemed out of place in a medical environment. When I asked them about this later, they just shrugged and said that's how they dress on Fridays. It was a bit weird.

I have mixed feelings about this GP surgery after my recent visit. On one hand, the receptionist was very friendly and made sure I had everything I needed before seeing the doctor. However, when it came time for us to receive our test results, the nurse seemed uncertain about how to communicate them to us, which made things more stressful than necessary.

I recently visited this GP surgery with a few concerns and was generally satisfied with the service I received.

The GP surgery has a lot of potential, but it fell short during my recent visit. The waiting room was comfortable and well-ventilated, making the experience even better. However, when I finally saw the doctor, they were in a rush and barely spoke to me before dismissing me. To make matters worse, I received a bill for a medication that wasn't prescribed by them.

I have been going to this GP surgery for several years now, and overall, I am very satisfied with their service. The staff are friendly and welcoming, especially the receptionist who checks me in efficiently. However, sometimes it can take a while to see the doctor, which is frustrating at times. Despite this minor inconvenience, I would still recommend this surgery to others based on their excellent service.

The GP surgery has let me down on several occasions. First, they were unable to find the issue that had been bothering me for weeks, despite running multiple tests. When they did finally discover the problem, the nurse seemed uninterested in explaining what was wrong and how it could be treated. The only good thing about my experience was the receptionist's warm smile.

The GP surgery has left a sour taste in my mouth during my visit last week. The staff seemed disorganized and unfriendly, with the receptionist checking me in without even looking up from her phone.

"The staff were helpful and understanding, but the waiting time was long and uncomfortable. They kept us informed about our treatment options and answered all our questions. The doctor was very kind and explained everything clearly. My only criticism would be that they didn't check on us as often as I think they could have.

They were both friendly and professional, which made the whole process much easier than I expected. The waiting room was clean and comfortable, and there was plenty of refreshments available. Overall, I'm very happy with the service I received.

I found the staff at this surgery to be completely unhelpful and unprofessional. When my appointment was cancelled, they didn't offer me a new time or any explanation for why it had been changed. The receptionist just told me that it wasn't their fault and that I should contact the doctor's office directly if I wanted to know what was going on. This experience left me feeling frustrated and disappointed.

"The GP surgery's appointment availability is a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, they do offer early morning appointments which is great for those like me who have an early work schedule. However, I've had to wait around for what felt like hours on multiple occasions just because the system couldn't find someone available at the time I requested. The receptionist always apologizes and offers a free drink while we wait, but it's not exactly convenient.

On the other hand, the GP itself is very competent and takes the time to listen to my concerns. They also have a great team of nurses who are friendly and knowledgeable. However, when I asked about getting a GP on call for after-hours emergencies, they told me that wasn't an option due to staffing constraints. This made me worry about what would happen if something urgent came up outside of regular office hours.

I've had mostly positive experiences at this surgery, but the appointment availability can be quite frustrating at times. The staff is generally friendly and competent, but it seems like they're often understaffed which causes delays.

"The staff were helpful but took ages to see the doc.

I found the waiting room to be spotlessly clean and comfortable, which was a relief after a long journey. However, I couldn't help feeling frustrated with the prolonged wait time – over an hour for a routine check-up! The receptionist seemed apologetic about it, but I just wanted my appointment to start already.

I had mixed feelings about my visit. On one hand, the nurse was very caring and explained everything in detail. On the other hand, the waiting room was tiny and crowded, and I felt like I was squished in among all those chairs. It took 45 minutes just to get checked in, and another hour or so for the actual consultation.

The wait time at this surgery was excessively long – over two hours! The staff seemed overwhelmed, but I couldn't help feeling annoyed that my time wasn't valued more. The receptionist kept apologizing and trying to make it up to me with extra information about my test results, which appreciated, but didn't fix the overall frustration.

I recently had a good experience at this surgery. However, my partner had a completely different story. They said they waited for over an hour just to see the doctor, and when they were finally called in, the nurse seemed rushed and dismissive. I'm glad that wasn't my experience, but it's still concerning to hear about such long wait times.

The surgery was efficient and well-run, which is always a plus. But the waiting area could be improved – it felt cramped and uncomfortable for a long time. My appointment took 20 minutes, though, so that made up for the discomfort. Overall, I'd recommend this place but only if you're prepared to wait.

I had mixed feelings about my visit – the staff were friendly but the waiting room was tiny and outdated. The receptionist tried her best, but it felt like we were kept in limbo for ages while everyone else seemed to be let through ahead of us. On the bright side, the nurse was lovely and explained everything clearly.

It's always a relief to find a surgery that's well-organized and professional. This place definitely delivers on both counts – except maybe with the waiting time. We waited for over an hour just to see our doctor, but at least they were apologetic about it and offered us refreshments in the end.

I went to this surgery recently, and I have to say it was a pleasant experience overall. The receptionist made check-in easy, and the nurse explained everything in detail. However, the waiting room felt cramped and uncomfortable, especially for people with mobility issues – I saw several people struggling to find seats because there weren't enough.

I recently had an unexpectedly good time at this surgery. The staff were friendly, the waiting area was clean and modern, and my appointment took only 15 minutes. The receptionist even gave me a nice cup of tea while I waited! However, I did notice that some other patients seemed to be kept waiting for ages, which might be a concern.

I had an okay experience at this surgery – nothing special, but nothing bad either. The staff were professional and friendly, and the waiting room was tidy. However, my appointment took over an hour just to see my doctor, which felt excessive given that it was a routine check-up.

"The staff were professional and efficient, making my visit smooth. However, they could have been more patient with a young child who became restless during the appointment. Overall, it was a good experience, but not exceptional. I would recommend this surgery to others, but only if you're looking for standard care rather than an outstanding one.

The receptionist seemed distant and uninterested in my concerns, which made me feel like just another statistic in the system. The nurse did try to help, but her efforts were hindered by a lack of communication between staff members. I left feeling frustrated and unheard. The surgery itself was fine, but the attitude of some staff left a bad taste.

I had high expectations after reading reviews online, but unfortunately, my experience fell short. The waiting room was cramped, and there wasn't enough seating for patients with mobility issues. When it was finally my turn to be seen, I felt rushed and didn't get a chance to ask all the questions I had. Maybe they were busy during peak hours, but still, it's not an ideal solution.

The staff at this surgery were incredibly kind and welcoming. They made sure I was comfortable throughout my appointment, checking in on me regularly and offering refreshments when needed. The doctor was also very patient and took the time to explain everything in detail. I felt truly cared for during my visit, which is a rare experience in medical settings.

I was disappointed with the lack of communication from the staff regarding my test results. They kept saying I would receive the report 'soon' without providing any estimated timeframe. It wasn't until I followed up that I finally got an answer.

"The staff were friendly and helpful but a bit slow.
I had to wait 20 minutes for my appointment to start.
The receptionist made an effort to make me feel comfortable, though. 
On the other hand, I was shocked by how dismissive one of the nurses was when she asked about my test results.
She barely looked at me and quickly moved on without explaining what it meant.

They asked the right questions, but I felt like they weren't really listening.
Despite this, the nurse explained everything in detail and answered all my questions honestly.
However, when it came time for test results, there was an uncomfortable pause before someone finally spoke up about what they meant.
I left feeling a bit frustrated by the lack of clear communication.
It's almost as if they were waiting for me to ask the right question so I could understand.

I recently had a positive experience with my GP practice staff. They were very caring and understanding during an appointment.
They listened attentively to my concerns and provided reassurance without judgment.

I found the receptionist to be somewhat unhelpful, failing to address several of my concerns. The nurse was competent but seemed put off by my questions.

The staff's professionalism is a major plus for our practice, making it easy to schedule appointments and trust the care I receive. However, there were a few hiccups with communication between departments, which was disappointing. Overall, we strive to provide exceptional patient care, and most of the time, we succeed. But when issues arise, they can be frustrating. Thankfully, our receptionist made an effort to follow up on my concerns after I left.

The GP's staff were very professional and caring during my visit, but the waiting room was cold and uncomfortable, which detracted from the overall experience. The receptionist offered a warm welcome, while the nurse provided clear explanations of my test results.

I recently had an issue with my prescription, and unfortunately, the staff at this surgery seemed uninterested in resolving it. Despite multiple attempts to explain the problem, they struggled to find a solution. It's not that they were unhelpful by nature; rather, their apathy was palpable.

I was really put off by the reception staff's attitude when I arrived. They seemed completely uninterested in helping me and just wanted to get on with things as quickly as possible.

I found the nursing staff to be particularly impressive, demonstrating excellent communication skills and a genuine interest in my well-being. They explained everything clearly and took the time to answer all my questions. The doctor was also very professional, though I felt he could have been more patient with me during the appointment. Overall, it was a pleasant experience despite some minor hiccups.

I was somewhat disappointed with the level of care I received from the staff. Despite being told they were busy, the receptionist seemed more interested in chatting with her colleague than attending to my needs. When I finally saw the nurse, she was rushed and didn't take the time to explain everything properly. It felt like I was just another patient in a long line rather than an individual person.

The staff at this surgery are absolutely fantastic. They were all so kind, friendly, and welcoming from the moment I walked in. The receptionist offered me a cup of tea, which is such a nice touch, and the nurse explained everything in detail without rushing me. When it was time to see the doctor, she took her time with me and listened attentively to all my concerns.

Unfortunately, my experience at this surgery was quite frustrating.

The nurse didn't seem to care that I was still waiting to see the doctor after what felt like an eternity.

I recently visited this GP surgery and had a good experience overall. The staff were all very friendly and made an effort to put me at ease, which is more than I can say for many other surgeries I've been to. However, when it came time to discuss my actual symptoms with the doctor, she seemed somewhat dismissive of my concerns.

I'm not sure what to make of this surgery yet, but my first visit left a lot to be desired. The receptionist was unfriendly and didn't seem to care that I had an appointment at all. When I finally saw the nurse, she seemed distracted and barely made eye contact with me. It felt like I was just another forgotten patient.

"The GP surgery staff were generally helpful but sometimes a bit disorganized with appointments. The receptionist often had to call multiple times to confirm my availability, which was inconvenient.

I have mixed feelings about the appointment availability at this surgery. While they do make an effort to accommodate last-minute cancellations and rescheduling requests, there's still room for improvement in terms of efficiency and communication. Sometimes I find myself waiting around for 10-15 minutes before being seen, which can be frustrating, especially if I've traveled a long distance.

I recently visited this GP surgery and had mixed experiences with their appointment availability. On the one hand, they did manage to fit me in on short notice when my usual GP was unavailable, which I appreciated. However, once I arrived at the surgery, it took them over an hour to call me through for a consultation, which felt rushed and impersonal.

I have been going to this GP surgery for years and have generally been happy with their service, but their appointment availability can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes they do everything right and get me in on time, but other times I find myself waiting around for far too long, which is frustrating because I value my time.

The GP surgery staff are knowledgeable and caring, but the appointment system can be a bit of a nightmare. I've lost count of how many times I've had to call multiple times just to confirm my availability, or waited around for what felt like an eternity before being seen. It's not always easy to get an appointment at short notice.

I recently tried to schedule an appointment with this GP surgery and was disappointed by the experience. The website didn't seem to be working properly, and when I tried to call them to make a booking, they put me on hold for over 20 minutes before finally answering my question. It took multiple attempts to get a definitive answer about availability.

I've been going to this GP surgery for years and have always found their staff to be friendly and helpful, but the appointment system can be quite inflexible. Sometimes I find myself having to choose between an early or late appointment time that doesn't suit me, which isn't ideal. Overall, however, I do appreciate the effort they make to accommodate my needs.

The GP surgery's appointment availability is a mixed bag. On the one hand, they do offer a range of flexible appointment times and a 24-hour booking service, which is convenient for those with non-traditional work hours or busy lifestyles. However, sometimes the system can be slow to respond, or I find myself having to wait around for far too long before being seen.

I was really impressed with this GP surgery when I first started attending them, but unfortunately their appointment availability has declined significantly in recent months.

"The GP practice staff were friendly and welcoming however I had to wait for over an hour before being seen which was disappointing.

I found the waiting time to be unacceptable, we waited 45 minutes for our appointment but the receptionist didn't provide us with any information about why it was delayed. 

We waited 20 minutes before being seen and when we did see the doctor she seemed rushed and wasn't very informative about my diagnosis or treatment options.

I recently attended this surgery after a referral from my GP and found the waiting time to be quite long, around 30-40 minutes. The receptionist was polite but apologetic, which I appreciated. However, it would have been better if they could have given us a more accurate estimate of how long we would wait.

Unfortunately, our visit to this surgery was marred by an incredibly long waiting time, over 1 hour and 15 minutes to be seen.

I was impressed by the level of care I received during my recent visit. The nurse took time to explain my treatment options in detail, and the doctor's bedside manner was exceptional. However, the waiting room was not cleaned regularly enough, which made it feel unhygienic.

The GP surgery staff were unfriendly and dismissive when I arrived for my appointment. They barely acknowledged me or explained my test results, leaving me feeling confused and frustrated. Despite this poor start, the doctor's professionalism and kindness helped turn the visit around.

"The GP practice staff were generally very helpful and knowledgeable about vaccinations. They answered all my questions thoroughly and made sure I understood the benefits and risks of each vaccine. The consultation itself was efficient and well-organized, with minimal waiting time. However, I did find the facility to be a bit outdated and in need of renovation, which detracted slightly from my overall experience. Overall, I would highly recommend this practice for vaccination needs.

I recently visited the GP surgery for my annual flu vaccine and had a disappointing experience. The receptionist seemed put off by my presence, and the nurse took ages to administer the jab, making me feel rushed. When I expressed some concerns about potential side effects, she became defensive and dismissive, which was not reassuring. To make matters worse, they didn't provide me with any aftercare advice or a list of contacts for follow-up questions.

The GP surgery has an excellent reputation for vaccination services, but my most recent visit left me feeling underwhelmed. The staff seemed competent enough, but the experience felt impersonal and rushed. I was given a choice of vaccines without being fully informed about their differences, which made me hesitant to make a decision. Luckily, the doctor took time to explain things in detail and answered all my questions thoroughly.

I recently had my first jab at this GP surgery for a new vaccine series and found it to be an excellent experience overall. The staff were friendly and approachable, with clear explanations of what I would need to do after the vaccination. However, the waiting room was quite cramped and hot, which made me uncomfortable. Despite this minor inconvenience, I felt well-informed and looked forward to my next visit.

I visited the GP surgery for a childhood immunization appointment when I was younger, but unfortunately, the experience has left a sour taste in my mouth. The nurse seemed very overwhelmed and stressed, which put me at ease more than the other patients did. She didn't seem to be paying much attention to me, even after I had asked several questions about the vaccines being administered.

I recently visited the GP surgery for a flu shot, but unfortunately, it was a frustrating experience due to the inefficient system they have in place. The receptionist seemed overwhelmed and kept pushing me towards an appointment time without checking if that was feasible for my schedule. When I politely expressed my concerns, she became quite dismissive.

After being vaccinated at this GP surgery last week, I felt very positive about the experience overall. However, when trying to find out more information on the specific vaccines they were administering, I found that the staff seemed vague and didn't have access to detailed patient records for me to review. Despite some minor issues with communication, I would still recommend this practice due to their general commitment to vaccination services.

Unfortunately, my experience at this GP surgery was a mixed bag when it came to vaccinations. On one hand, I appreciated how the staff were so willing to answer all of my questions and made sure that everything went smoothly during the consultation. However, they also seemed quite hesitant about offering me some additional booster shots, even though I had explicitly asked about them beforehand.

I recently visited the GP surgery for a vaccination against a relatively new disease, and overall, I was very pleased with the service provided. The receptionist made sure that everything went according to schedule, and the nurse explained everything in great detail before administering the vaccine. However, when discussing potential risks associated with the vaccine, the doctor seemed somewhat hesitant to answer my questions thoroughly.

My most recent visit to this GP surgery left me feeling rather disappointed with regards to their vaccination services. I had requested a specific vaccine which they were unable to provide due to supply issues, and was offered an alternative without being fully informed of its differences. The staff seemed unenthusiastic about the whole experience, which didn't exactly put me at ease.

I recently visited this GP surgery for my annual flu shot, but was shocked by how little information they provided on the vaccine I received. When I asked the nurse what specific strains it protected against, she merely said that it would ""provide some protection."" The consultation itself was fine, but overall, I felt rather uninformed about what was happening to me.

When I visited the GP surgery for a vaccination at the start of this year, I noticed some inconsistencies in the information provided by different staff members. One receptionist told me one thing, while another nurse said something entirely different. This lack of coherence left me feeling somewhat confused and uncertain about what I had been vaccinated against.

I recently went to this GP surgery for a booster shot, and found that the experience was quite pleasant overall.
